</div>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The recent outbreak of a fraction of the
Chiricahua Apaches, and the frightful atrocities
which have marked their trail through Arizona,
Sonora, New Mexico, and Chihuahua, has attracted
renewed attention to these brave but
bloodthirsty aborigines and to the country exposed
to their ravages.</p>

<p>The contents of this book, which originally
appeared in a serial form in the <cite>Outing Magazine</cite>
of Boston, represent the details of the expedition
led by General Crook to the Sierra
Madre, Mexico, in 1883; but, as the present
military operations are conducted by the same
commander, against the same enemy, and upon
the same field of action, a perusal of these pages
will, it is confidently believed, place before the
reader a better knowledge of the general situation
than any article which is likely soon to
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p>There is this difference to be noted, however;
of the one hundred and twenty-five (125) fighting
men brought back from the Sierra Madre,
less than one-third have engaged in the present
hostilities, from which fact an additional inference
may be drawn both of the difficulties to
be overcome in the repression of these disturbances
and of the horrors which would surely
have accumulated upon the heads of our citizens
had the <em>whole</em> fighting force of this fierce
band taken to the mountains.</p>

<p>One small party of eleven (11) hostile Chiricahuas,
during the period from November 15th,
1885, to the present date, has killed twenty-one
(21) friendly Apaches living in peace upon the
reservation, and no less than twenty-five (25)
white men, women, and children. This bloody
raid has been conducted through a country
filled with regular troops, militia, and “rangers,”&mdash;and
at a loss to the enemy, so far as can be
shown, of only one man, whose head is now at
Fort Apache.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I.</h2>


<p>Within the compass of this volume it is impossible
to furnish a complete dissertation
upon the Apache Indians or the causes which
led up to the expedition about to be described.
The object is simply to outline some of the difficulties
attending the solution of the Indian
question in the South-west and to make known
the methods employed in conducting campaigns
against savages in hostility. It is thought that
the object desired can best be accomplished by
submitting an unmutilated extract from the
journal carefully kept during the whole period
involved.</p>

<p>Much has necessarily been excluded, but
without exception it has been to avoid repetition,
or else to escape the introduction of information
bearing upon the language, the religion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
marriages, funeral ceremonies, etc., of this interesting
race, which would increase the bulk
of the manuscript, and, perhaps, detract from
its value in the eyes of the general reader.</p>

<p>Ethnologically the Apache is classed with
the Tinneh tribes, living close to the Yukon
and Mackenzie rivers, within the Arctic circle.
For centuries he has been preëminent over the
more peaceful nations about him for courage,
skill, and daring in war; cunning in deceiving
and evading his enemies; ferocity in attack
when skilfully-planned ambuscades have led
an unwary foe into his clutches; cruelty and
brutality to captives; patient endurance and
fortitude under the greatest privations.</p>

<p>In peace he has commanded respect for keen-sighted
intelligence, good fellowship, warmth
of feeling for his friends, and impatience of
wrong.</p>

<p>No Indian has more virtues and none has
been more truly ferocious when aroused. He
was the first of the native Americans to defeat
in battle or outwit in diplomacy the all-conquering,
smooth-tongued Spaniard, with whom
and his Mexican-mongrel descendants he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
waged cold-blooded, heart-sickening war since
the days of Cortés. When the Spaniard had
fire-arms and corselet of steel he was unable to
push back this fierce, astute aborigine, provided
simply with lance and bow. The past fifty
years have seen the Apache provided with
arms of precision, and, especially since the introduction
of magazine breech-loaders, the
Mexican has not only ceased to be an intruder
upon the Apache, but has trembled for the
security of life and property in the squalid
hamlets of the States of Chihuahua and Sonora.</p>

<p>In 1871 the War Department confided to
General George Crook the task of whipping
into submission all the bands of the Apache
nation living in Arizona. How thoroughly
that duty was accomplished is now a matter of
history. But at the last moment one band&mdash;the
Chiricahuas&mdash;was especially exempted from
Crook’s jurisdiction. They were not attacked
by troops, and for years led a Jack-in-the-box
sort of an existence, now popping into an
agency and now popping out, anxious, if their
own story is to be credited, to live at peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
with the whites, but unable to do so from lack
of nourishment.</p>

<p>When they went upon the reservation, rations
in abundance were promised for themselves
and families. A difference of opinion
soon arose with the agent as to what constituted
a ration, the wicked Indians laboring
under the delusion that it was enough food to
keep the recipient from starving to death, and
objecting to an issue of supplies based upon
the principle according to which grumbling
Jack-tars used to say that prize-money was
formerly apportioned,&mdash;that is, by being thrown
through the rungs of a ladder&mdash;what stuck being
the share of the Indian, and what fell to
the ground being the share of the agent. To
the credit of the agent it must be said that he
made a praiseworthy but ineffectual effort to
alleviate the pangs of hunger by a liberal distribution
of hymn-books among his wards.
The perverse Chiricahuas, not being able to
digest works of that nature, and unwilling to
acknowledge the correctness of the agent’s arithmetic,
made up their minds to sally out from
San Carlos and take refuge in the more hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
wilderness of the Sierra Madre. Their
discontent was not allayed by rumors whispered
about of the intention of the agent to
have the whole tribe removed bodily to the
Indian Territory. Coal had been discovered on
the reservation, and speculators clamored that
the land involved be thrown open for development,
regardless of the rights of the Indians.
But, so the story goes, matters suddenly reached
a focus when the agent one day sent his chief of
police to arrest a Chiricahua charged with some
offense deemed worthy of punishment in the
guard-house. The offender started to run
through the Indian camp, and the chief of police
fired at him, but missed his aim and killed a
luckless old squaw, who happened in range.
This wretched marksmanship was resented by
the Chiricahuas, who refused to be comforted
by the profuse apologies tendered for the accident.
They silently made their preparations,
waiting long enough to catch the chief of police,
kill him, cut off his head, and play a game
of foot-ball with it; and then, like a flock of
quail, the whole band, men, women, and children&mdash;710
in all&mdash;started on the dead run for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the Mexican boundary, one hundred and fifty
miles to the south.</p>

<p>Hotly pursued by the troops, they fought
their way across Southern Arizona and New
Mexico, their route marked by blood and devastation.
The valleys of the Santa Cruz and
San Pedro witnessed a repetition of the once
familiar scenes of farmers tilling their fields
with rifles and shot-guns strapped to the plow-handle.
While engaged in fighting off the
American forces, which pressed too closely upon
their rear, the Apaches were attacked in front
by the Mexican column under Colonel Garcia,
who, in a savagely contested fight, achieved a
“substantial victory,” killing eighty-five and
capturing thirty, eleven of which total of one
hundred and fifteen were men, and the rest
women and children. The Chiricahuas claim
that when the main body of their warriors
reached the scene of the engagement the Mexicans
evinced no anxiety to come out from the
rifle-pits they hastily dug. To this fact no
allusion can be found in the Mexican commander’s
published dispatches.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i018" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE VILLAGE SCENE.</div>
</div>

<p>The Chiricahuas, now reduced to an aggregate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of less than 600&mdash;150 of whom were warriors
and big boys, withdrew to the recesses
of the adjacent Sierra Madre&mdash;their objective
point. Not long after this the Chiricahuas
made overtures for an armistice with the Mexicans,
who invited them to a little town near
Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, for a conference.
They were courteously received, plied with
liquor until drunk, and then attacked tooth and
nail, ten or twelve warriors being killed and
some twenty-live or thirty women hurried off
to captivity.</p>

<p>This is a one-sided description of the affair,
given by a Chiricahua who participated. The
newspapers of that date contained telegraph accounts
of a fierce battle and another “victory”
from Mexican sources; so that no doubt there
is some basis for the story.</p>

<p>Meantime General Crook had been reassigned
by the President to the command of the Department
of Arizona, which he had left nearly
ten years previously in a condition of peace and
prosperity, with the Apaches hard at work
upon the reservation, striving to gain a living
by cultivating the soil. Incompetency and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
rascality, in the interval, had done their worst,
and when Crook returned not only were the
Chiricahuas on the war-path, but all the other
bands of the Apache nation were in a state
of scarcely concealed defection and hostility.
Crook lost not a moment in visiting his old
friends among the chiefs and warriors, and by
the exercise of a strong personal influence,
coupled with assurances that the wrongs of
which the Apaches complained should be
promptly redressed, succeeded in averting an
outbreak which would have made blood flow
from the Pecos to the Colorado, and for the
suppression of which the gentle and genial tax-payer
would have been compelled to contribute
most liberally of his affluence. Attended by
an aid-de-camp, a surgeon, and a dozen Apache
scouts, General Crook next proceeded to the
south-east corner of Arizona, from which point
he made an attempt to open up communication
with the Chiricahuas. In this he was unsuccessful,
but learned from a couple of squaws,
intercepted while attempting to return to the
San Carlos, that the Chiricahuas had sworn vengeance
upon Mexicans and Americans alike;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that their stronghold was an impregnable position
in the Sierra Madre, a “great way” below
the International Boundary; and that they supplied
themselves with an abundance of food by
raiding upon the cattle-ranches and “haciendas”
in the valleys and plains below.</p>

<p>Crook now found himself face to face with
the following intricate problem: The Chiricahuas
occupied a confessedly impregnable position
in the precipitous range known as the
Sierra Madre. This position was within the
territory of another nation so jealous of its
privileges as not always to be able to see clearly
in what direction its best interests lay. The
territory harassed by the Chiricahuas not only
stretched across the boundary separating Mexico
from the United States, but was divided
into four military departments&mdash;two in each
country; hence an interminable amount of jealousy,
suspicion, fault-finding, and antagonism
would surely dog the steps of him who should
endeavor to bring the problem to a solution.</p>

<p>To complicate matters further, the Chiricahuas,
and all the other Apaches as well, were
filled with the notion that the Mexicans were a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
horde of cowards and treacherous liars, afraid
to meet them in war but valiant enough to destroy
their women and children, for whose
blood, by the savage’s law of retaliation, blood
must in turn be shed. Affairs went on in this
unsatisfactory course from October, 1882, until
March, 1883, everybody in Arizona expecting a
return of the dreaded Chiricahuas, but no one
knowing where the first attack should be made.
The meagre military force allotted to the department
was distributed so as to cover as many
exposed points as possible, one body of 150
Apache scouts, under Captain Emmet Crawford,
Third Cavalry, being assigned to the arduous
duty of patrolling the Mexican boundary
for a distance of two hundred miles, through
a rugged country pierced with ravines and
cañons. No <ins class="corr" id="tn-10" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'one was suprised'">
one was surprised</ins> to learn that
toward the end of March this skeleton line had
been stealthily penetrated by a bold band of
twenty-six Chiricahuas, under a very crafty
and daring young chief named <em>Chato</em> (Spanish
for Flat Nose).</p>

<p>By stealing fresh horses from every ranch
they were successful in traversing from seventy-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
to one hundred miles a day, killing and destroying
all in their path, the culminating point
in their bloody career being the butchery of
Judge McComas and wife, prominent and refined
people of Silver City, N. M., and the abduction
of their bright boy, Charlie, whom the
Indians carried back with them on their retreat
through New Mexico and Chihuahua.</p>

<p>It may serve to give some idea of the courage,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-11" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'boldness, and sublety'">
boldness, and subtlety</ins> of these raiders to
state that in their dash through Sonora, Arizona,
New Mexico, and Chihuahua, a distance of
not less than eight hundred miles, they passed
at times through localities fairly well settled and
close to an aggregate of at least 5,000 troops&mdash;4,500
Mexican and 500 American. They killed
twenty-five persons, Mexican and American, and
lost but two&mdash;one killed near the Total Wreck
mine, Arizona, and one who fell into the hands
of the American troops, of which last much has
to be narrated.</p>

<p>To attempt to catch such a band of Apaches
by <em>direct</em> pursuit would be about as hopeless a
piece of business as that of catching so many
fleas. All that could be done was done; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
country was alarmed by telegraph; people at
exposed points put upon their guard, while detachments
of troops scoured in every direction,
hoping, by good luck, to intercept, retard, mayhap
destroy, the daring marauders. The trail
they had made coming up from Mexico could,
however, be followed, <em>back</em> to the stronghold;
and this, in a military sense, would be the most
<em>direct</em>, as it would be the most practical pursuit.</p>

<p>Crook’s plans soon began to outline themselves.
He first concentrated at the most eligible
position on the Southern Pacific Railroad&mdash;Willcox&mdash;all
the skeletons of companies which
were available, for the protection of Arizona.</p>

<p>Forage, ammunition, and subsistence were
brought in on every train; the whole organization
was carefully inspected, to secure the rejection
of every unserviceable soldier, animal,
or weapon; telegrams and letters were sent to
the officers commanding the troops of Mexico,
but no replies were received, the addresses of
the respective generals not being accurately
known. As their co-operation was desirable,
General Crook, as a last resort, went by railroad
to Guaymas, Hermosillo, and Chihuahua,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
there to see personally and confer with the
Mexican civil and military authorities. The
cordial reception extended him by all classes
was the best evidence of the high regard in
which he was held by the inhabitants of the
two afflicted States of Sonora and Chihuahua,
and of their readiness to welcome any force he
would lead to effect the destruction or removal
of the common enemy. Generals Topete and
Carbó&mdash;soldiers of distinction&mdash;the governors
of the two States, and Mayor Zubiran, of Chihuahua,
were most earnest in their desire for
a removal of savages whose presence was a
cloud upon the prosperity of their fellow-citizens.
General Crook made no delay in these
conferences, but hurried back to Willcox and
marched his command thence to the San Bernardino
springs, in the south-east corner of the
Territory (Arizona).</p>

<p>But serious delays and serious complications
were threatened by the intemperate behavior
of an organization calling itself the “Tombstone
Rangers,” which marched in the direction of the
San Carlos Agency with the avowed purpose
of “cleaning out” all the Indians there congregated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
The chiefs and head men of the
Apaches had just caused word to be telegraphed
to General Crook that they intended
sending him another hundred of their picked
warriors as an assurance and pledge that they
were not in sympathy with the Chiricahuas on
the war-path. Upon learning of the approach
of the “Rangers” the chiefs prudently deferred
the departure of the new levy of scouts until
the horizon should clear, and enable them to
see what was to be expected from their white
neighbors.</p>

<p>The whiskey taken along by the “Rangers”
was exhausted in less than ten days, when the
organization expired of thirst, to the gratification
of the respectable inhabitants of the frontier,
who repudiated an interference with the
plans of the military commander, respected and
esteemed by them for former distinguished services.</p>

<p>At this point it may be well to insert an
outline of the story told by the Chiricahua
captive who had been brought down from the
San Carlos Agency to Willcox. He said that
his name was Pa-nayo-tishn (<ins class="corr" id="tn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Cayote saw'">
the Coyote saw</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
him); that he was not a Chiricahua, but a
White Mountain Apache of the Dest-chin (or
Red Clay) clan, married to two Chiricahua women,
by whom he had had children, and with
whose people he had lived for years. He had
left the Chiricahua stronghold in the mountain
called Pa-gotzin-kay some five days’ journey
below Casas Grandes in Chihuahua. From that
stronghold the Chiricahuas had been raiding
with impunity upon the Mexicans. When pursued
they would draw the Mexicans into the
depths of the mountains, ambuscade them, and
kill them by rolling down rocks from the
heights.</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas had plenty of horses and
cattle, but little food of a vegetable character.
They were finely provided with sixteen-shooting
breech-loading rifles, but were getting short of
ammunition, and had made their recent raid into
Arizona, hoping to replenish their supply of
cartridges. Dissensions had broken out among
the chiefs, some of whom, he thought, would
be glad to return to the reservation. In making
raids they counted upon riding from sixty to
seventy-five miles a day as they stole fresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
horses all the time and killed those abandoned.
It would be useless to pursue them, but he
would lead General Crook back along the trail
they had made coming up from Mexico, and he
had no doubt the Chiricahuas could be taken
by surprise.</p>

<p>He had not gone with them of his own free
will, but had been compelled to leave the reservation,
and had been badly treated while
with them. The Chiricahuas left the San Carlos
because the agent had stolen their rations,
beaten their women, and killed an old squaw.
He asserted emphatically that no communication
of any kind had been held with the
Apaches at San Carlos, every attempt in that
direction having been frustrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i030" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i030.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE WAR-DANCE.</div>
</div>

<p>The Chiricahuas, according to Pa-nayo-tishn,
numbered seventy full-grown warriors and fifty
big boys able to fight, with an unknown number
of women and children. In their fights with the
Mexicans about one hundred and fifty had been
killed and captured, principally women and children.
The stronghold in the Sierra Madre was
described as a dangerous, rocky, almost inaccessible
place, having plenty of wood, water, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
grass, but no food except what was stolen from
the Mexicans. Consequently the Chiricahuas
might be starved out.</p>

<p>General Crook ordered the irons to be struck
from the prisoner; to which he demurred, saying
he would prefer to wear shackles for the
present, until his conduct should prove his sincerity.
A half-dozen prominent scouts promised
to guard him and watch him; so the
fetters were removed, and Pa-nayo-tishn or
“Peaches,” as the soldiers called him, was installed
in the responsible office of guide of the
contemplated expedition.</p>

<p>By the 22d of April many of the preliminary
arrangements had been completed and some of
the difficulties anticipated had been smoothed
over. Nearly 100 Apache scouts joined the
command from the San Carlos Reservation, and
in the first hours of night began a war-dance,
which continued without a break until the first
flush of dawn the next day. They were all in
high feather, and entered into the spirit of the
occasion with full zest. Not much time need
be wasted upon a description of their dresses;
they didn’t wear any, except breech-clout and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
moccasins. To the music of an improvised
drum and the accompaniment of marrow-freezing
yells and shrieks they pirouetted and
charged in all directions, swaying their bodies
violently, dropping on one knee, then suddenly
springing high in air, discharging their pieces,
and all the time chanting a rude refrain, in
which their own prowess was exalted and that
of their enemies alluded to with contempt.
Their enthusiasm was not abated by the announcement,
quietly diffused, that the “medicine
men” had been hard at work, and had
succeeded in making a “medicine” which
would surely bring the Chiricahuas to grief.</p>

<p>In accordance with the agreement entered
into with the Mexican authorities, <ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Amercan troops'">
the American troops</ins> were to reach the boundary line <em>not
sooner than May 1</em>, the object being to let the
restless Chiricahuas quiet down as much as
possible, and relax their vigilance, while at the
same time it enabled the Mexican troops to get
into position for effective co-operation.</p>

<p>The convention between our government and
that of Mexico, by which a reciprocal crossing
of the International Boundary was conceded to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the troops of the two republics, stipulated that
such crossing should be authorized when the
troops were “in close pursuit of a band of
savage Indians,” and the crossing was made
“in the unpopulated or desert parts of said
boundary line,” which unpopulated or desert
parts “had to be two leagues from any encampment
or town of either country.” The
commander of the troops crossing was to give
notice at time of crossing, or before if possible,
to the nearest military commander or civil
authority of the country entered. The pursuing
force was to retire to its own territory as
soon as it should have fought the band of
which it was in pursuit, or lost the trail; and
in no case could it “establish itself or remain
in the foreign territory for a longer time than
necessary to make the pursuit of the band
whose trail it had followed.”</p>

<p>The weak points of this convention were the
imperative stipulation that the troops should
return at once after a fight and the ambiguity
of the terms “close pursuit,” and “unpopulated
country.” A friendly expedition from the
United States might follow close on the heels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
of a party of depredating Apaches, but, under
a rigid construction of the term “unpopulated,”
have to turn back when it had reached some
miserable hamlet exposed to the full ferocity
of savage attack, and most in need of assistance,
as afterwards proved to be the case.</p>

<p>The complication was not diminished by the
orders dispatched by General Sherman on March
31 to General Crook to continue the pursuit of
the Chiricahuas “without regard to departmental
or national boundaries.” Both General Crook
and General Topete, anxious to have every difficulty
removed which lay in the way of a
thorough adjustment of this vexed question,
telegraphed to their respective governments
asking that a more elastic interpretation be given
to the terms of the convention.</p>

<p>To this telegram General Crook received reply
that he must abide strictly by the terms of
the convention, which could only be changed
with the concurrence of the Mexican Senate.
But what these terms meant exactly was left
just as much in the dark as before. On the 23d
of April General Crook moved out from Willcox,
accompanied by the Indian scouts and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
force of seven skeleton companies of the Third
and Sixth Cavalry, under Colonel James Biddle,
guarding a train of wagons, with supplies of
ammunition and food for two months. This
force, under Colonel Biddle, was to remain in
reserve at or near San Bernardino Springs on
the Mexican boundary, while its right and left
flanks respectively were to be covered by detachments
commanded by Rafferty, Vroom, Overton,
and Anderson; this disposition affording the best
possible protection to the settlements in case any
of the Chiricahuas should make their way to
the rear of the detachment penetrating Mexico.</p>

<p>A disagreeable sand-storm enveloped the column
as it left the line of the Southern Pacific
Railroad, preceded by the detachment of Apache
scouts. A few words in regard to the peculiar
methods of the Apaches in marching and conducting
themselves while on a campaign may
not be out of place. To veterans of the campaigns
of the Civil War familiar with the compact
formations of the cavalry and infantry of
the Army of the Potomac, the loose, straggling
methods of the Apache scouts would appear
startling, and yet no soldier would fail to apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
at a glance that the Apache was the perfect,
the ideal, scout of the whole world. When
Lieutenant Gatewood, the officer in command,
gave the short, jerky order, Ugashé&mdash;Go!&mdash;the
Apaches started as if shot from a gun, and in a
minute or less had covered a space of one hundred
yards front, which distance rapidly widened
as they advanced, at a rough, shambling
walk, in the direction of Dos Cabezas (Two
Heads), the mining camp near which the first
halt was to be made.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i038" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i038.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE INDIAN SCOUTS EXAMINING TRAILS BY NIGHT.</div>
</div>

<p>They moved with no semblance of regularity;
individual fancy alone governed. Here
was a clump of three; not far off two more,
and scattered in every point of the compass,
singly or in clusters, were these indefatigable
scouts, with vision as keen as a hawk’s, tread
as untiring and as stealthy as the panther’s,
and ears so sensitive that nothing escapes them.
An artist, possibly, would object to many of
them as undersized, but in all other respects
they would satisfy every requirement of anatomical
criticism. Their chests were broad,
deep, and full; shoulders perfectly straight;
limbs well-proportioned, strong, and muscular,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
without a suggestion of undue heaviness; hands
and feet small and taper but wiry; heads
well-shaped, and countenances often lit up with
a pleasant, good-natured expression, which
would be more constant, perhaps, were it not
for the savage, untamed cast imparted by the
loose, disheveled, gypsy locks of raven black,
held away from the face by a broad, flat band
of scarlet cloth. Their eyes were bright, clear,
and bold, frequently expressive of the greatest
good-humor and satisfaction. Uniforms had
been issued, but were donned upon ceremonial
occasions only. On the present march each
wore a loosely fitting shirt of red, white, or
gray stuff, generally of calico, in some gaudy
figure, but <ins class="corr" id="tn-23" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'not infreqently the'">
not infrequently the</ins> sombre article of
woollen raiment issued to white soldiers. This
came down outside a pair of loose cotton drawers,
reaching to the moccasins. The moccasins
are the most important articles of Apache apparel.
In a fight or on a long march they will
discard all else, but under any and every circumstance
will retain the moccasins. These
had been freshly made before leaving Willcox.
The Indian to be fitted stands erect upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
ground while a companion traces with a sharp
knife the outlines of the sole of his foot upon
a piece of rawhide. The leggin is made of soft
buckskin, attached to the foot and reaching to
mid-thigh. For convenience in marching, it is
allowed to hang in folds below the knee. The
raw-hide sole is prolonged beyond the great
toe, and turned upward in a shield, which protects
from cactus and sharp stones. A leather
belt encircling the waist holds forty rounds of
metallic cartridges, and also keeps in place the
regulation blue blouse and pantaloons, which
are worn upon the person only when the Indian
scout is anxious to “paralyze” the frontier
towns <ins class="corr" id="tn-24" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'or millitary posts'">
or military posts</ins> by a display of all his
finery.</p>

<p>The other trappings of these savage auxiliaries
are a Springfield breech-loading rifle, army
pattern, a canteen full of water, a butcher knife,
an awl in leather case, a pair of tweezers, and
a tag. The awl is used for sewing moccasins
or work of that kind. With the tweezers the
Apache young man carefully picks out each
and every hair appearing upon his face. The
tag marks his place in the tribe, and is in reality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
nothing more or less than a revival of a
plan adopted during the war of the rebellion
for the identification of soldiers belonging to
the different corps and divisions. Each male
Indian at the San Carlos is tagged and numbered,
and a descriptive list, corresponding to
the tag kept, with a full recital of all his physical
peculiarities.</p>

<p>This is the equipment of each and every
scout; but there are many, especially the
more pious and influential, who carry besides,
strapped at the waist, little buckskin bags of
Hoddentin, or sacred meal, with which to
offer morning and evening sacrifice to the sun
or other deity. Others, again, are provided
with amulets of lightning-riven twigs, pieces
of quartz crystal, petrified wood, concretionary
sandstone, galena, or chalchihuitls, or fetiches
representing some of their countless
planetary gods or Kân, which are regarded
as the “dead medicine” for frustrating the
designs of the enemy or warding off arrows
and bullets in the heat of action. And a few
are happy in the possession of priceless sashes
and shirts of buckskin, upon which are emblazoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the signs of the sun, moon, lightning,
rainbow, hail, fire, the water-beetle, butterfly,
snake, centipede, and other powers to
which they may appeal for aid in the hour
of distress.</p>

<p>The Apache is an eminently religious person,
and the more deviltry he plans the more
pronounced does his piety become.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i043" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i043.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE AWL-CASES, TOBACCO BAGS, AND HEAD-DRESSES
WORN BY YOUNG GIRLS.</div>
</div>

<p>The rate of speed attained by the Apaches
in marching is about an even four miles an
hour on foot, or not quite fast enough to make
a horse trot. They keep this up for about
fifteen miles, at the end of which distance, if
water be encountered and no enemy be sighted,
they congregate in bands of from ten to fifteen
each, hide in some convenient ravine, sit down,
smoke cigarettes, chat and joke, and stretch
out in the sunlight, basking like the negroes
of the South. If they want to make a little
fire, they kindle one with matches, if they
happen to have any with them; if not, a rapid
twirl, between the palms, of a hard round
stick fitting into a circular hole in another stick
of softer fiber, will bring fire in from eight to
forty-five seconds. The scouts by this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
have painted their faces, daubing them with
red ochre, deer’s blood, or the juice of roasted
“mescal.” The object of this is protection
from wind and sun, as well as distinctive ornamentation.</p>

<p>The first morning’s rest of the Apaches was
broken by the shrill cry of Choddi! Choddi!
(Antelope! Antelope!) and far away on the
left the dull slump! slump! of rifles told that
the Apaches on that flank were getting fresh
meat for the evening meal. Twenty carcasses
demonstrated that they were not the worst of
shots; neither were they, by any means, bad
cooks.</p>

<p>When the command reached camp these restless,
untiring nomads built in a trice all kinds
of rude shelters. Those that had the army
“dog tents” put them up on frame-works of
willow or cotton-wood saplings; others, less
fortunate, improvised domiciles of branches
covered with grass, or of stones and boards
covered with gunny sacks. Before these were
finished smoke curled gracefully toward the
sky from crackling embers, in front of which,
transfixed on wooden spits, were the heads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
hearts, and livers of several of the victims of
the afternoon’s chase. Another addition to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spolia opima</i> was a cotton-tailed rabbit,
run down by these fleet-footed Bedouins of the
South-west. Turkeys and quail are caught
in the same manner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a couple of scouts were making
bread,&mdash;the light, thin “tortillas” of the Mexicans,
baked quickly in a pan, and not bad
eating. Two others were fraternally occupied
in preparing their bed for the night. Grass
was pulled by handfuls, laid upon the ground,
and covered with one blanket, another serving
as cover. These Indians, with scarcely an
exception, sleep with their feet pointed toward
little fires, which, they claim, are warm,
while the big ones built by the American soldiers,
are so hot that they drive people away
from them, and, besides, attract the attention
of a lurking enemy. At the foot of this bed
an Apache was playing on a home-made fiddle,
fabricated from the stalk of the “mescal,” or
American aloe. This fiddle has four strings,
and emits a sound like the wail of a cat with
its tail caught in a fence. But the noble red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
man likes the music, which perhaps is, after
all, not so very much inferior to that of
Wagner.</p>

<p>Enchanted and stimulated by the concord of
sweet sounds, a party of six was playing fiercely
at the Mexican game of “monte,” the cards employed
being of native manufacture, of horse-hide,
covered with barbarous figures, and well
worthy of a place in any museum.</p>

<p>The cooking was by this time ended, and the
savages, with genuine hospitality, invited the
Americans near them to join in the feast. It
was not conducive to appetite to glance at dirty
paws tearing bread and meat into fragments;
yet the meat thus cooked was tender and juicy,
the bread not bad, and the coffee strong and
fairly well made. The Apaches squatted nearest
to the American guests felt it incumbent
upon them to explain everything as the meal
progressed. They said this (pointing to the
coffee) is Tu-dishishn (black water), and that
Zigosti (bread).</p>

<p>All this time scouts had been posted commanding
every possible line of approach. The
Apache dreads surprise. It is his own favorite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
mode of destroying an enemy, and knowing
what he himself can do, he ascribes to his foe&mdash;no
matter how insignificant may be his numbers&mdash;the
same daring, recklessness, agility,
and subtlety possessed by himself. These Indian
scouts will march thirty-five or forty miles
in a day on foot, crossing wide stretches of
waterless plains upon which a tropical sun
beats down with fierceness, or climbing up the
faces of precipitous mountains which stretch
across this region in every direction.</p>

<p>The two great points of superiority of the
native or savage soldier over the representative
of civilized discipline are his absolute knowledge
of the country and his perfect ability to
take care of himself at all times and under all
circumstances. Though the rays of the sun
pour down from the zenith, or the scorching
sirocco blow from the south, the Apache scout
trudges along as unconcerned as he was when
the cold rain or snow of winter chilled his
white comrade to the marrow. He finds food,
and pretty good food too, where the Caucasian
would starve. Knowing the habits of wild
animals from his earliest youth, he can catch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
turkeys, quail, rabbits, doves, or field-mice, and,
perhaps, a prairie-dog or two, which will supply
him with meat. For some reason he cannot
be induced to touch fish, and bacon or any
other product of the hog is eaten only under
duress; but the flesh of a horse, mule, or jackass,
which has dropped exhausted on the march
and been left to die on the trail, is a delicious
morsel which the Apache epicure seizes upon
wherever possible. The stunted oak, growing
on the mountain flanks, furnishes acorns; the
Spanish bayonet, a fruit that, when roasted in
the ashes of a camp-fire, looks and tastes something
like the banana. The whole region of
Southern Arizona and Northern Mexico is matted
with varieties of the cactus, nearly every
one of which is called upon for its tribute of
fruit or seed. The broad leaves and stalks of
the century-plant&mdash;called mescal&mdash;are roasted
between hot stones, and the product is rich in
saccharine matter and extremely pleasant to the
taste. The wild potato and the bulb of the
“tule” are found in the damp mountain meadows;
and the nest of the ground-bee is raided
remorselessly for its little store of honey. Sunflower-seeds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
when ground fine, are rich and
nutritious. Walnuts grow in the deep ravines,
and strawberries in favorable locations; in the
proper season these, with the seeds of wild
grasses and wild pumpkins, the gum of the
“mesquite,” or the sweet, soft inner bark of the
pine, play their part in staving off the pangs of
hunger.</p>

<p>The above are merely a few of the resources
of the Apache scout when separated from the
main command. When his moccasins give out
on a long march over the sharp rocks of the
mountains or the cutting sands of the plains, a
few hours’ rest sees him equipped with a new
pair,&mdash;his own handiwork,&mdash;and so with other
portions of his raiment. He is never without
awl, needle, thread, or sinew. Brought up from
infancy to the knowledge and use of arms of
some kind,&mdash;at first the bow and arrow, and
later on the rifle,&mdash;he is perfectly at home with
his weapons, and knowing from past experience
how important they are for his preservation,
takes much better care of them than does the
white soldier out of garrison.</p>

<p>He does not read the newspapers, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
great book of nature is open to his perusal, and
has been drained of much knowledge which his
pale-faced brother would be glad to acquire.
Every track in the trail, mark in the grass,
scratch on the bark of a tree, explains itself to
the “untutored” Apache. He can tell to an
hour, almost, when the man or animal making
them passed by, and, like a hound, will keep
on the scent until he catches up with the object
of his pursuit.</p>

<p>In the presence of strangers the Apache soldier
is sedate and taciturn. Seated around his
little apology for a camp-fire, in the communion
of his fellows, he becomes vivacious and conversational.
He is obedient to authority, but
will not brook the restraints which, under our
notions of discipline, change men into machines.
He makes an excellent sentinel, and not a single
instance can be adduced of property having been
stolen from or by an Apache on guard.</p>

<p>He has the peculiarity, noticed among so
many savage tribes in various parts of the world,
of not caring to give his true name to a stranger;
if asked for it, he will either give a wrong one
or remain mute and let a comrade answer for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
him. This rule does not apply where he has
been dubbed with a sobriquet by the white soldiers.
In such case he will respond promptly,
and tell the inquirer that he is “Stumpy,” “Tom
Thumb,” “Bill,” “Humpy Sam,” or “One-Eyed
Reilly,” as the case may be. But there is no
such exception in regard to the dead. Their
names are never mentioned, even by the wailing
friends who loudly chant their virtues.</p>

<p>Approaching the enemy his vigilance is a
curious thing to witness. He avoids appearing
suddenly upon the crest of a hill, knowing that
his figure projected against the sky can at such
time be discerned from a great distance. He will
carefully bind around his brow a sheaf of grass,
or some other foliage, and thus disguised crawl
like a snake to the summit and carefully peer
about, taking in with his keen black eyes the
details of the country to the front with a rapidity,
and thoroughness the American or European
can never acquire. In battle he is again
the antithesis of the Caucasian. The Apache
has no false ideas about courage; he would prefer
to skulk <ins class="corr" id="tn-34" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'like the cayote'">
like the coyote</ins> for hours, and then
kill his enemy, or capture his herd, rather than,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
by injudicious exposure, receive a wound, fatal
or otherwise. But he is no coward; on the
contrary, he is entitled to rank among the
bravest. The precautions taken for his safety
prove that he is an exceptionally skillful soldier.
His first duty under fire is to jump for a rock,
bush, or hole, from which no enemy can drive
him except with loss of life or blood.</p>

<p>The policy of Great Britain has always been
to enlist a force of auxiliaries from among the
natives of the countries falling under her sway.
The Government of the United States, on the
contrary, has persistently ignored the really excellent
material, ready at hand, which could,
with scarcely an effort and at no expense, be
mobilized, and made to serve as a frontier police.
General Crook is the only officer of our army
who has fully recognized the incalculable value
of a native contingent, and in all his campaigns
of the past thirty-five years has drawn about
him as soon as possible a force of Indians, which
has been serviceable as guides and trailers, and
also of consequence in reducing the strength of
the opposition.</p>

<p>The white army of the United States is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
much better body of officers and men than a
critical and censorious public gives it credit for
being. It represents intelligence of a high
order, and a spirit of devotion to duty worthy
of unbounded praise; but it does not represent
the acuteness of the savage races. It cannot
follow the trail like a dog on the scent. It may
be brave and well-disciplined, but its members
cannot tramp or ride, as the case may be, from
forty to seventy-five miles in a day, without
water, under a burning sun. No civilized army
can do that. It is one of the defects of civilized
training that man develops new wants, awakens
new necessities,&mdash;becomes, in a word, more and
more a creature of luxury.</p>

<p>Take the Apache Indian under the glaring
sun of Mexico. He quietly peels off all his
clothing and enjoys the fervor of the day more
than otherwise. He may not be a great military
genius, but he is inured to all sorts of
fatigue, and will be hilarious and jovial when
the civilized man is about to die of thirst.</p>

<p>Prominent among these scouts was of course
first of all “Peaches,” the captive guide. He
was one of the handsomest men, physically, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
be found in the world. He never knew what
it was to be tired, cross, or out of humor. His
knowledge of the topography of Northern Sonora
was remarkable, and his absolute veracity
and fidelity in all his dealings a notable feature
in his character. With him might be mentioned
“Alchise,” “Mickey Free,” “Severiano,” “Nockié-cholli,”
“Nott,” and dozens of others, all tried
and true men, experienced in warfare and devoted
to the general whose standard they followed.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="II">II.</h2>
</div>


<p>From Willcox to San Bernardino Springs,
by the road the wagons followed, is an even
100 miles. The march thither, through a most
excellent grazing country, was made in five
days, by which time the command was joined
by Captain Emmet Crawford, Third Cavalry,
with more than 100 additional Apache scouts
and several trains of pack-mules.</p>

<p>San Bernardino Springs break out from the
ground upon the Boundary Line and flow
south into the Yaqui River, of which the San
Bernardino River is the extreme head. These
springs yielded an abundance of water for all
our needs, and at one time had refreshed thousands
of head of cattle, which have since disappeared
under the attrition of constant warfare
with the Apaches.</p>

<p>The few days spent at San Bernardino were
days of constant toil and labor; from the first
streak of dawn until far into the night the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
task of organizing and arranging went on.
Telegrams were dispatched to the Mexican
generals notifying them that the American
troops would leave promptly by the date
agreed upon, and at last the Indian scouts
began their war-dances, and continued them
without respite from each sunset until the next
sunrise. In a conference with General Crook
they informed him of their anxiety to put an
end to the war and bring peace to Arizona, so
that the white men and Apaches could live
and work side by side.</p>

<p>By the 29th of April all preparations were
complete. Baggage had been cut down to a
minimum. Every officer and man was allowed
to carry the clothes on his back, one blanket
and forty rounds of ammunition. Officers were
ordered to mess with the packers and on the
same food issued to soldiers and Indian scouts.
One hundred and sixty rounds of extra ammunition
and rations of hard-bread, coffee and
bacon, for sixty days, were carried on pack-mules.</p>

<p>At this moment General Sherman telegraphed
to General Crook that he must not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
cross the Mexican boundary in pursuit of Indians,
except in strict accord with the terms of
the treaty, without defining exactly what those
terms meant. Crook replied, acknowledging
receipt of these instructions and saying that he
would respect treaty stipulations.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, May 1st, 1883, the expedition
crossed the boundary into Mexico. Its exact
composition was as follows: General George
Crook, in command. Captain John G. Bourke,
Third Cavalry, acting adjutant-general; Lieutenant
G. S. Febiger, engineer officer, aid-de-camp;
Captain Chaffee, Sixth Cavalry, with
Lieutenants West and Forsyth, and forty-two
enlisted men of “I” company of that regiment;
Doctor Andrews, Private A. F. Harmer of the
General Service, and 193 Indian scouts, under
Captain Emmet Crawford, Third Cavalry,
Lieutenant Mackey, Third Cavalry, and Gatewood,
Sixth Cavalry, with whom were Al.
Zeiber, McIntosh, “Mickey Free,” Severiano,
and Sam Bowman, as interpreters.</p>

<p>The pack-mules, for purposes of efficient
management, were divided into five trains, each
with its complement of skilled packers. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
trains were under charge of Monach, Hopkins,
Stanfield, “Long Jim Cook,” and “Short Jim
Cook.”</p>

<p>Each packer was armed with carbine and
revolver, for self-protection, but nothing could
be expected of them, in the event of an attack,
beyond looking out for the animals. Consequently
the effective fighting strength of the
command was a little over fifty white men&mdash;officers
and soldiers&mdash;and not quite 200 Apache
scouts, representing the various bands, Chiricahua,
White Mountain, Yuma, Mojave, and
Tonto.</p>

<p>The first rays of the sun were beaming upon
the Eastern hills as we swung into our saddles,
and, amid a chorus of good-byes and God-bless-yous
from those left behind, pushed down the
hot and sandy valley of the San Bernardino,
past the mouth of Guadalupe cañon, to near
the confluence of Elias Creek, some twenty
miles. Here camp was made on the banks of
a pellucid stream, under the shadow of graceful
walnut and ash trees. The Apache scouts had
scoured the country to the front and on both
flanks, and returned loaded with deer and wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
turkeys, the latter being run down and caught
in the bushes. One escaped from its captors
and started through camp on a full jump, pursued
by the Apaches, who, upon re-catching it,
promptly twisted its head off.</p>

<p>The Apaches were in excellent spirits, the
“medicine-men” having repeated with emphasis
the prediction that the expedition was
to be a grand success. One of the most influential
of them&mdash;a mere boy, who carried the
most sacred medicine&mdash;was especially positive
in his views, and, unlike most prophets, backed
them up with a bet of $40.</p>

<p>On May 2, 1883, breakfasted at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
The train&mdash;Monach’s&mdash;with which we took
meals was composed equally of Americans and
Mexicans. So, when the cook spread his canvas
on the ground, one heard such expressions
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tantito’ zucarito quiero</i>; <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sirve pasar el
járabe</i>; <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pase rebanada de pan</i>; <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Otra gotita
mas de café</i>, quite as frequently as their English
equivalents, “I’d like a little more sugar,”
“Please pass the sirup,” “Hand me a slice of
bread,” “A little drop of coffee.” Close by,
the scouts consumed their meals, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
more silence, yet not so silently but that their
calls for <i>inchi</i> (salt), <i>ikôn</i> (flour), <i>pezá-a</i> (frying-pan),
and other articles, could be plainly
heard.</p>

<p>Martin, the cook, deserves some notice. He
was not, as he himself admitted, a French cook
by profession. His early life had been passed
in the more romantic occupation of driving an
ore-wagon between Willcox and Globe, and,
to quote his own proud boast, he could “hold
down a sixteen-mule team with any outfit this
side the Rio Grande.”</p>

<p>But what he lacked in culinary knowledge
he more than made up in strength and agility.
He was not less than six feet two in his socks,
and built like a young Hercules. He was gentle-natured,
too, and averse to fighting. Such,
at least, was the opinion I gathered from a
remark he made the first evening I was thrown
into his society.</p>

<p>His eyes somehow were fixed on mine, while
he said quietly, “If there’s anybody here don’t
like the grub, I’ll kick a lung out of him!” I
was just about suggesting that a couple of
pounds less saleratus in the bread and a couple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of gallons less water in the coffee would be
grateful to my Sybarite palate; but, after this
conversation, I reflected that the fewer remarks
I made the better would be the chances of my
enjoying the rest of the trip; so I said nothing.
Martin, I believe, is now in Chihuahua,
and I assert from the depths of an outraged
stomach, that a better man or a worse cook
never thumped a mule or turned a flapjack.</p>

<p>The march was continued down the San Bernardino
until we reached its important affluent,
the Bávispe, up which we made our way until
the first signs of habitancy were encountered
in the squalid villages of Bávispe, Basaraca,
and Huachinera.</p>

<p>The whole country was a desert. On each
hand were the ruins of depopulated and abandoned
hamlets, destroyed by the Apaches. The
bottom-lands of the San Bernardino, once smiling
with crops of wheat and barley, were now
covered with a thickly-matted jungle of semi-tropical
vegetation. The river banks were
choked by dense brakes of cane of great size
and thickness. The narrow valley was hemmed
in by rugged and forbidding mountains, gashed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and slashed with a thousand ravines, to cross
which exhausted both strength and patience.
The foot-hills were covered with <i>chevaux de
frise</i> of Spanish bayonet, mescal, and cactus.
The lignum-vitæ flaunted its plumage of crimson
flowers, much like the fuchsia, but growing
in clusters. The grease-wood, ordinarily so
homely, here assumed a garniture of creamy
blossoms, rivaling the gaudy dahlia-like cups
upon the nopal, and putting to shame the modest
tendrils pendent from the branches of the
mesquite.</p>

<p>The sun glared down pitilessly, wearing out
the poor mules, which had as much as they
could do to scramble over the steep hills, composed
of a nondescript accumulation of lava,
sandstone, porphyry, and limestone, half-rounded
by the action of water, and so loosely
held together as to slip apart and roll away
the instant the feet of animals or men touched
them.</p>

<p>When they were not slipping over loose
stones or climbing rugged hills, they were breaking
their way through jungles of thorny vegetation,
which tore their quivering flesh. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of the mules, falling from the rocks, impaled
itself upon a mesquite branch, and had to be
killed.</p>

<p>Through all this the Apache scouts trudged
without a complaint, and with many a laugh
and jest. Each time camp was reached they
showed themselves masters of the situation.
They would gather the saponaceous roots of
the yucca and Spanish bayonet, to make use of
them in cleaning their long, black hair, or cut
sections of the bamboo-like cane and make pipes
for smoking, or four-holed flutes, which emitted
a weird, Chinese sort of music, responded to
with melodious chatter by countless birds
perched in the shady seclusion of ash and cotton-wood.</p>

<p>Those scouts who were not on watch gave
themselves up to the luxury of the tá-a-chi, or
sweat-bath. To construct these baths, a dozen
willow or cotton-wood branches are stuck in
the ground and the upper extremities, united
to form a dome-shaped frame-work, upon which
are laid blankets to prevent the escape of heat.
Three or four large rocks are heated and placed
in the centre, the Indians arranging themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
around these rocks and bending over them.
Silicious bowlders are invariably selected, and
not calcareous&mdash;the Apaches being sufficiently
familiar with rudimentary mineralogy to know
that the latter will frequently crack and explode
under intense heat.</p>

<p>When it came to my time to enter the sweat-lodge
I could see nothing but a network of
arms and legs, packed like sardines. An extended
experience with Broadway omnibuses
assured me that there must always be room for
one more. The smile of the “medicine-man”&mdash;the
master of ceremonies&mdash;encouraged me to
push in first an arm, then a leg, and, finally,
my whole body.</p>

<p>Thump! sounded the damp blanket as it
fell against the frame-work and shut out all
light and air. The conductor of affairs inside
threw a handful of water on the hot rocks, and
steam, on the instant, filled every crevice of
the den. The heat was that of a bake-oven;
breathing was well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>“Sing,” said in English the Apache boy,
“Keet,” whose legs and arms were sinuously intertwined
with mine; “sing heap; sleep moocho<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
to-night; eat plenny dinna to-mollo.” The
other bathers said that everybody must sing.
I had to yield. My <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repertoire</i> consists of but
one song&mdash;the lovely ditty&mdash;“Our captain’s
name is Murphy.” I gave them this with all
the lung-power I had left, and was heartily encored;
but I was too much exhausted to respond,
and rushed out, dripping with perspiration,
to plunge with my dusky comrades into
the refreshing waters of the Bávispe, which
had worn out for themselves tanks three to
twenty feet deep. The effects of the bath were
all that the Apaches had predicted&mdash;a sound,
refreshing sleep and increased appetite.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i070" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i070.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE HEAD-DRESSES, SHOES, TOYS, ETC.</div>
</div>

<p>The farther we got into Mexico the greater
the desolation. The valley of the Bávispe,
like that of the San Bernardino, had once been
thickly populated; now all was wild and gloomy.
Foot-prints indeed were plenty, but they were
the fresh moccasin-tracks of Chiricahuas, who
apparently roamed with immunity over all this
solitude. There were signs, too, of Mexican
“travel;” but in every case these were “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conductas</i>”
of pack-mules, guarded by companies
of soldiers. Rattlesnakes were encountered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
with greater frequency both in camp and on
the march. When found in camp the Apaches,
from superstitious reasons, refrained from killing
them, but let the white men do it.</p>

<p>The vegetation remained much the same as
that of Southern Arizona, only denser and
larger. The cactus began to bear odorous
flowers&mdash;a species of night-blooming cereus&mdash;and
parrots of gaudy plumage flitted about
camp, to the great joy of the scouts, who, catching
two or three, tore the feathers from their
bodies and tied them in their inky locks.
Queenly humming-birds of sapphire hue darted
from bush to bush and tree to tree. Every one
felt that we were advancing into more torrid
regions. However, by this time faces and
hands were finely tanned and blistered, and the
fervor of the sun was disregarded. The nights
remained cool and refreshing throughout the
trip, and, after the daily march or climb, soothed
to the calmest rest.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May the column reached the
feeble, broken-down towns of Bávispe and Basaraca.
The condition of the inhabitants was
deplorable. Superstition, illiteracy, and bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
government had done their worst, and, even
had not the Chiricahuas kept them in mortal
terror, it is doubtful whether they would have
had energy enough to profit by the natural advantages,
mineral and agricultural, of their immediate
vicinity. The land appeared to be
fertile and was well watered. Horses, cattle,
and chickens throve; the cereals yielded an
abundant return; and scarlet blossoms blushed
in the waxy-green foliage of the pomegranate.</p>

<p>Every man, woman, and child had gathered
in the streets or squatted on the flat roofs of
the adobe houses to welcome our approach with
cordial acclamations. They looked like a grand
national convention of scarecrows and rag-pickers,
their garments old and dingy, but no
man so poor that he didn’t own a gorgeous sombrero,
with a snake-band of silver, or display
a flaming sash of cheap red silk and wool.
Those who had them displayed rainbow-hued
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serapes</i> flung over the shoulders; those who
had none went in their shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>The children were bright, dirty, and pretty;
the women so closely enveloped in their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rebozos</i>
that only one eye could be seen. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
greeted our people with warmth, and offered to
go with us to the mountains. With the volubility
of parrots they began to describe a most
blood-thirsty fight recently had with the Chiricahuas,
in which, of course, the Apaches had
been completely and ignominiously routed, each
Mexican having performed prodigies of valor
on a par with those of Ajax. But at the same
time they wouldn’t go alone into their fields,&mdash;only
a quarter of a mile off,&mdash;which were <ins class="corr" id="tn-51" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'constantly patroled'">
constantly patrolled</ins> by a detachment of twenty-five
or thirty men of what was grandiloquently
styled the National Guard. “Peaches,” the
guide, smiled quietly, but said nothing, when
told of this latest annihilation of the Chiricahuas.
General Crook, without a moment’s hesitancy,
determined to keep on the trail farther
into the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p>The food of these wretched Mexicans was
mainly <em>atole</em>,&mdash;a weak flour-gruel resembling
the paste used by our paper-hangers. Books
they had none, and newspapers had not yet
been heard of. Their only recreation was in
religious festivals, occurring with commendable
frequency. The churches themselves were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the last stages of dilapidation; the adobe exteriors
showed dangerous indications of approaching
dissolution, while the tawdry ornaments
of the inside were foul and black with
age, smoke, dust, and rain.</p>

<p>I asked a small, open-mouthed boy to hold
my horse for a moment until I had examined
one of these edifices, which bore the elaborate
title of the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre and
our Lady of the Trance. This action evoked a
eulogy from one of the bystanders: “This man
can’t be an American, he must be a Christian,”
he sagely remarked; “he speaks Castilian, and
goes to church the first thing.”</p>

<p>It goes without saying that they have no
mails in that country. What they call the
post-office of Basaraca is in the store of the
town. The store had no goods for sale, and
the post-office had no stamps. The postmaster
didn’t know when the mail would go; it used
to go every eight days, but now&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quien sabe?</i>
Yes, he would send our letters the first opportunity.
The price? Oh! the price?&mdash;did the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballeros</i> want to know how much? Well, for
Mexican people, he charged five cents, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the Americans would have to pay <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dos reales</i>
(twenty-five cents) for each letter.</p>

<p>The only supplies for sale in Basaraca were
fiery mescal, chile, and a few eggs, eagerly
snapped up by the advance-guard. In making
these purchases we had to enter different
houses, which vied with each other in penury
and destitution. There were no chairs, no tables,
none of the comforts which the humblest
laborers in our favored land demand as right
and essential. The inmates in every instance
received us urbanely and kindly. The women,
who were uncovered inside their domiciles, were
greatly superior in good looks and good breeding
to their husbands and brothers; but the
latter never neglected to employ all the punctilious
expressions of Spanish politeness.</p>

<p>That evening the round-stomached old man,
whom, in ignorance of the correct title, we all
agreed to call the Alcalde, paid a complimentary
visit to General Crook, and with polite
flourishes bade him welcome to the soil of Mexico
informed him that he had received orders
to render the expedition every assistance in his
power, and offered to accompany it at the head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of every man and boy in the vicinity. General
Crook felt compelled to decline the assistance
of these valiant auxiliaries, but asked permission
to buy four beeves to feed to the Apache
scouts, who did not relish bacon or other salt
meat.</p>

<p>Bivouac was made that night on the banks
of the Bávispe, under the bluff upon which
perched the town of Basaraca. Numbers of
visitors&mdash;men and boys&mdash;flocked in to see us,
bringing bread and tobacco for barter and sale.
In their turn a large body of our people went
up to the town and indulged in the unexpected
luxury of a ball. This was so entirely original
in all its features that a mention of it is admissible.</p>

<p>Bells were ringing a loud peal, announcing
that the morrow would be Sunday, when a prolonged
thumping of drums signaled that the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Baile</i> was about to begin.</p>

<p>Wending our way to the corner whence the
noise proceeded, we found that a half-dozen of
the packers had bought out the whole stock of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tienda</i>, which dealt only in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i>, paying
therefor the princely sum of $12.50.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Invitations had been extended to all the
adult inhabitants to take part in the festivities.
For some reason all the ladies sent regrets by
the messenger; but of men there was no lack,
the packers having taken the precaution to
send out a patrol to scour the streets, “collar”
and “run in” every male biped found outside
his own threshold. These captives were first
made to drink a tumbler of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i> to the
health of the two great nations, Mexico and the
United States,&mdash;and then were formed into
quadrille sets, moving in unison with the orchestra
of five pieces,&mdash;two drums, two squeaky
fiddles, and an accordion.</p>

<p>None of the performers understood a note of
music. When a new piece was demanded, the
tune had to be whistled in the ears of the bass-drummer,
who thumped it off on his instrument,
followed energetically by his enthusiastic
assistants.</p>

<p>This orchestra was augmented in a few moments
by the addition of a young boy with a
sax-horn. He couldn’t play, and the horn had
lost its several keys, but he added to the noise
and was welcomed with screams of applause.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
It was essentially a <em>stag</em> party, but a very funny
one. The new player was doing some good
work when a couple of dancers whirled into
him, knocking him clear off his pins and astride
of the bass-drum and drummer.</p>

<p>Confusion reigned only a moment; good
order was soon restored, and the dance would
have been resumed with increased jollity had
not the head of the bass-drum been helplessly
battered.</p>

<p>Midnight had long since been passed, and
there was nothing to be done but break up the
party and return to camp.</p>

<p>From Basaraca to Tesorababi&mdash;over twenty
miles&mdash;the line of march followed a country
almost exactly like that before described. The
little hamlets of Estancia and Huachinera were
perhaps a trifle more squalid than Bávispe or
Basaraca, and their churches more dilapidated;
but in that of Huachinera were two or three
unusually good oil-paintings, brought from
Spain a long time ago. Age, dust, weather,
and candle-grease had almost ruined, but had
not fully obliterated, the touch of the master-hand
which had made them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Tesorababi must have been, a couple of generations
since, a very noble ranch. It has
plenty of water, great groves of oak and mesquite,
with sycamore and cotton-wood growing
near the water, and very nutritious grass upon
the neighboring hills. The buildings have fallen
into ruin, nothing being now visible but the
stout walls of stone and adobe. Mesquite trees
of noble size choke up the corral, and everything
proclaims with mute eloquence the supremacy
of the Apache.</p>

<p>Alongside of this ranch are the ruins of an
ancient pueblo, with quantities of broken pottery,
stone mortars, Obsidian flakes and kindred
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reliquiæ</i>.</p>

<p>To Tesorababi the column was accompanied
by a small party of guides sent out by the Alcalde
of Basaraca. General Crook ordered them
back, as they were not of the slightest use so
long as we had such a force of Apache scouts.</p>

<p>We kept in camp at Tesorababi until the
night of May 7, and then marched straight for
the Sierra Madre. The foot-hills were thickly
covered with rich <em>grama</em> and darkened by
groves of scrub-oak. Soon the oak gave way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to cedar in great abundance, and the hills and
ridges became steeper as we struck the trail
lately made by the Chiricahuas driving off cattle
from Sahuaripa and Oposura. We were
fairly within the range, and had made good
progress, when the scouts halted and began to
explain to General Crook that nothing but bad
luck could be expected if he didn’t set free an
owl which one of our party had caught, and
tied to the pommel of his saddle.</p>

<p>They said the owl (Bû) was a bird of ill-omen,
and that we could not hope to whip the
Chiricahuas so long as we retained it. These
solicitations bore good fruit. The moon-eyed
bird of night was set free and the advance resumed.
Shortly before midnight camp was
made in a very deep cañon, thickly wooded, and
having a small stream a thousand feet below
our position. No fires were allowed, and some
confusion prevailed among the pack-mules,
which could not find their places.</p>

<p>Very early the next morning (May 8, 1883)
the command moved in easterly direction up
the cañon. This was extremely rocky and steep.
Water stood in pools everywhere, and animals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
and men slaked their fierce thirst. Indications
of Chiricahua depredations multiplied. The trail
was fresh and well-beaten, as if by scores&mdash;yes,
hundreds&mdash;of stolen ponies and cattle.</p>

<p>The carcasses of five freshly slaughtered
beeves lay in one spot; close to them a couple
more, and so on.</p>

<p>The path wound up the face of the mountain,
and became so precipitous that were a horse to
slip his footing he would roll and fall hundreds
of feet to the bottom. At one of the abrupt
turns could be seen, deep down in the cañon,
the mangled fragments of a steer which had
fallen from the trail, and been dashed to pieces
on the rocks below. It will save much repetition
to say, at this point, that from now on we
were never out of sight of ponies and cattle,
butchered, in every stage of mutilation, or alive,
and roaming by twos and threes in the ravines
and on the mountain flanks.</p>

<p>Climb! Climb! Climb! Gaining the summit
of one ridge only to learn that above it towered
another, the face of nature fearfully corrugated
into a perplexing alternation of ridges
and chasms. Not far out from the last bivouac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
was passed the spot where a large body of Mexican
troops had camped, the farthest point of
their penetration into the range, although their
scouts had been pushed in some distance farther,
only to be badly whipped by the Chiricahuas,
who sent them flying back, utterly demoralized.</p>

<p>These particulars may now be remarked of
that country: It seemed to consist of a series of
parallel and very high, knife-edged hills,&mdash;extremely
rocky and bold; the cañons all contained
water, either flowing rapidly, or else in tanks of
great depth. Dense pine forests covered the
ridges near the crests, the lower skirts being
matted with scrub-oak. Grass was generally
plentiful, but not invariably to be depended
upon. Trails ran in every direction, and upon
them were picked up all sorts of odds and ends
plundered from the Mexicans,&mdash;dresses, made
and unmade, saddles, bridles, letters, flour, onions,
and other stuff. In every sheltered spot could
be discerned the ruins,&mdash;buildings, walls, and
dams, erected by an extinct race, once possessing
this region.</p>

<p>The pack-trains had much difficulty in getting
along. Six mules slipped from the trail, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
rolled over and over until they struck the bottom
of the cañon. Fortunately they had selected
a comparatively easy grade, and none was
badly hurt.</p>

<p>The scouts became more and more vigilant
and the “medicine-men” more and more devotional.
When camp was made the high peaks
were immediately picketed, and all the approaches
carefully examined. Fires were allowed
only in rare cases, and in positions
affording absolute concealment. Before going
to bed the scouts were careful to fortify themselves
in such a manner that surprise was simply
impossible.</p>

<p>Late at night (May 8th) the “medicine-men”
gathered together for the never-to-be-neglected
duty of singing and “seeing” the Chiricahuas.
After some palaver I succeeded in obtaining
the privilege of sitting in the circle with them.
All but one chanted in a low, melancholy tone,
half song and half grunt. The solitary exception
lay as if in a trance for a few moments,
and then, half opening his lips, began to thump
himself violently in the breast, and to point to
the east and north, while he muttered: “Me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
can’t see the Chilicahuas yet. Bimeby me see
’um. Me catch ’um, me kill ’um. Me no catch
’um, me no kill ’um. Mebbe so six day me
catch ’um; mebbe so two day. Tomollow me
send twenty-pibe (25) men to hunt ’um tlail.
Mebbe so tomollow catch ’um squaw. Chilicahua
see me, me no get ’um. No see me,
me catch him. Me see him little bit now.
Mebbe so me see ’um more tomollow. Me
catch ’um, me kill ’um. Me catch ’um hoss, me
catch ’um mool (mule), me catch ’um cow. Me
catch Chilicahua pooty soon, bimeby. Me kill
’um heap, and catch ’um squaw.” These prophecies,
translated for me by an old friend in the
circle who spoke some English, were listened to
with rapt attention and reverence by the awe-struck
scouts on the exterior.</p>

<p>The succeeding day brought increased trouble
and danger. The mountains became, if anything,
steeper; the trails, if anything, more
perilous. Carcasses of mules, ponies, and cows
lined the path along which we toiled, dragging
after us worn-out horses.</p>

<p>It was not yet noon when the final ridge of
the day was crossed and the trail turned down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
a narrow, gloomy, and rocky gorge, which gradually
widened into a small amphitheatre.</p>

<p>This, the guide said, was the stronghold occupied
by the Chiricahuas while he was with
them; but no one was there now. For all purposes
of defense, it was admirably situated.
Water flowed in a cool, sparkling stream
through the middle of the amphitheatre. Pine,
oak, and cedar in abundance and of good size
clung to the steep flanks of the ridges, in whose
crevices grew much grass. The country, for a
considerable distance, could be watched from
the pinnacles upon which the savage pickets
had been posted, while their huts had been so
scattered and concealed in the different brakes
that the capture or destruction of the entire
band could never have been effected.</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas had evidently lived in this
place a considerable time. The heads and bones
of cows and ponies were scattered about on all
sides. Meat must have been their principal
food, since we discovered scarcely any mescal
or other vegetables. At one point the scouts
indicated where a mother had been cutting a
child’s hair; at another, where a band of youngsters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
had been enjoying themselves sliding down
rocks.</p>

<p>Here were picked up the implements used
by a young Chiricahua assuming the duties of
manhood. Like all other Indians they make
vows and pilgrimages to secluded spots, during
which periods they will not put their lips to
water, but suck up all they need through a
quill or cane. Hair-brushes of grass, bows and
arrows, and a Winchester rifle had likewise been
left behind by the late occupants.</p>

<p>The pack-trains experienced much difficulty
in keeping the trail this morning (May 9).
Five mules fell over the precipice and killed
themselves, three breaking their necks and two
having to be shot.</p>

  <div class="caption">APACHE WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS.</div>
</div>

<p>Being now in the very centre of the hostile
country, May 10, 1883, unusual precautions
were taken to guard against discovery or ambuscade,
and to hurry along the pack-mules.
Parties of Apache scouts were thrown out to
the front, flanks, and rear to note carefully
every track in the ground. A few were detailed
to stay with the pack-mules and guide
them over the best line of country. Ax-men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
were sent ahead on the trail to chop out trees
and remove rocks or other obstructions. Then
began a climb which reflected the experience
of the previous two days; if at all different, it
was much worse. Upon the crest of the first
high ridge were seen forty abandoned <em>jacales</em>
or lodges of branches; after that, another dismantled
village of thirty more, and then, in
every protected nook, one, two, or three, as
might be. Fearful as this trail was the Chiricahuas
had forced over it a band of cattle
and ponies, whose footprints had been fully
outlined in the mud, just hardened into clay.</p>

<p>After two miles of a very hard climb we slid
down the almost perpendicular face of a high
bluff of slippery clay and loose shale into an open
space dotted with Chiricahua huts, where, on a
grassy space, the young savages had been playing
their favorite game of mushka, or lance-billiards.</p>

<p>Two white-tailed deer ran straight into the
long file of scouts streaming down hill; a shower
of rocks and stones greeted them, and there was
much suppressed merriment, but not the least
bit of noisy laughter, the orders being to avoid
any cause of alarm to the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>A fearful chute led from this point down
into the gloomy chasm along which trickled
the head-waters of the Bávispe, gathering in
basins and pools clear as mirrors of crystal. A
tiny cascade babbled over a ledge of limestone
and filled at the bottom a dark-green reservoir
of unknown depth. There was no longer
any excitement about Chiricahua signs; rather,
wonder when none were to be seen.</p>

<p>The ashes of extinct fires, the straw of unused
beds, the skeleton frame-work of dismantled
huts, the play-grounds and dance-grounds,
mescal-pits and acorn-meal mills were visible
at every turn. The Chiricahuas must have felt
perfectly secure amid these towering pinnacles
of rock in these profound chasms, by these
bottomless pools of water, and in the depths
of this forest primeval. Here no human foe
could hope to conquer them. Notwithstanding
this security of position, “Peaches” asserted
that the Chiricahuas never relaxed vigilance.
No fires were allowed at night, and all
cooking was done at midday. Sentinels lurked
in every crag, and bands of bold raiders kept
the foot-hills thoroughly explored. Crossing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Bávispe, the trail zigzagged up the vertical
slope of a promontory nearly a thousand feet
above the level of the water. Perspiration
streamed from every brow, and mules and
horses panted, sweated, and coughed; but Up!
Up! Up! was the watchword.</p>

<p>Look out! came the warning cry from those
in the lead, and then those in the rear and
bottom dodged nervously from the trajectory
of rocks dislodged from the parent mass, and,
gathering momentum as each bound hurled
them closer to the bottom of the cañon. To
look upon the country was a grand sensation;
to travel in it, infernal. Away down at the
foot of the mountains the pack-mules could
be discerned&mdash;apparently not much bigger than
jack-rabbits,&mdash;struggling and panting up the
long, tortuous grade. And yet, up and down
these ridges the Apache scouts, when the idea
seized them, ran like deer.</p>

<p>One of them gave a low cry, half whisper,
half whistle. Instantly all were on the alert,
and by some indefinable means, the news
flashed through the column that two Chiricahuas
had been sighted a short distance ahead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
in a side cañon. Before I could write this
down the scouts had stripped to the buff,
placed their clothing in the rocks, and dispatched
ten or twelve of their number in swift
pursuit.</p>

<p>This proved to be a false alarm, for in an
hour they returned, having caught up with the
supposed Chiricahuas, who were a couple of
our own packers, off the trail, looking for stray
mules.</p>

<p>When camp was made that afternoon the
Apache scouts had a long conference with
General Crook. They called attention to the
fact that the pack-trains could not keep up
with them, that five mules had been killed on
the trail yesterday, and five others had rolled
off this morning, but been rescued with slight
injuries. They proposed that the pack-trains
and white troops remain in camp at this point,
and in future move so as to be a day’s march
or less behind the Apache scouts, 150 of whom,
under Crawford, Gatewood, and Mackey, with
Al. Zeiber and the other white guides, would
move out well in advance to examine the
country thoroughly in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>If they came upon scattered parties of the
hostiles they would attack boldly, kill as many
as they could, and take the rest back, prisoners,
to San Carlos. Should the Chiricahuas
be intrenched in a strong position, they would
engage them, but do nothing rash, until reinforced
by the rest of the command. General
Crook told them they must be careful not to
kill women or children, and that all who surrendered
should be taken back to the reservation
and made to work for their own living like
white people.</p>

<p>Animation and bustle prevailed everywhere;
small fires were burning in secluded nooks, and
upon the bright embers the scouts baked quantities
of bread to be carried with them. Some
ground coffee on flat stones; others examined
their weapons critically and cleaned their cartridges.
Those whose moccasins needed repair
sewed and patched them, while the more cleanly
and more religious indulged in the sweat-bath,
which has a semi-sacred character on such occasions.</p>

<p>A strong detachment of packers, soldiers, and
Apaches climbed the mountains to the south,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and reached the locality in the foot-hills where
the Mexicans and Chiricahuas had recently had
an engagement. Judging by signs it would
appear conclusive that the Indians had enticed
the Mexicans into an ambuscade, killed a number
with bullets and rocks, and put the rest to
ignominious flight. The “medicine-men” had
another song and pow-wow after dark. Before
they adjourned it was announced that in two
days, counting from the morrow, the scouts
would find the Chiricahuas, and in three days
kill a “heap.”</p>

<p>On May 11, 1883 (Friday), one hundred and
fifty Apache scouts, under the officers above
named, with Zeiber, “Mickey Free,” Severiano,
Archie McIntosh, and Sam Bowman, started
from camp, on foot, at daybreak. Each carried
on his person four days’ rations, a canteen, 100
rounds of ammunition, and a blanket. Those
who were to remain in camp picketed the three
high peaks overlooking it, and from which half
a dozen Chiricahuas could offer serious annoyance.
Most of those not on guard went down
to the water, bathed, and washed clothes. The
severe climbing up and down rough mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
slipping, falling, and rolling in dust and clay,
had blackened most of us like negroes.</p>

<p>Chiricahua ponies had been picked up in
numbers, four coming down the mountains of
their own accord, to join our herds; and altogether,
twenty were by this date in camp. The
suggestions of the locality were rather peaceful
in type; lovely blue humming-birds flitted from
bush to bush, and two Apache doll-babies lay
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was sinking behind the hills
in the west, a runner came back with a note
from Crawford, saying there was a fine camping
place twelve or fifteen miles across the
mountains to the south-east, with plenty of
wood, water, and grass.</p>

<p>For the ensuing three days the white soldiers
and pack-trains cautiously followed in the footsteps
of Crawford and the scouts, keeping a
sufficient interval between the two bodies to
insure thorough investigation of the rough
country in front. The trail did not improve
very much, although after the summit of a
high, grassy plateau had been gained, there was
easy traveling for several leagues. Pine-trees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of majestic proportions covered the mountain-tops,
and there was the usual thickness of
scrub-oak on the lower elevations. By the side
of the trail, either thrown away or else <em>cachéd</em>
in the trees, were quantities of goods left by
the Chiricahuas&mdash;calico, clothing, buckskin,
horse-hides, beef-hides, dried meat, and things
of that nature. The nights were very cool, the
days bright and warm. The Bávispe and its
tributaries were a succession of deep tanks of
glassy, pure water, in which all our people
bathed on every opportunity. The scouts
escorting the pack-trains gathered in another
score of stray ponies and mules, and were encouraged
by another note sent back by Crawford,
saying that he had passed the site of
a Chiricahua village of ninety-eight <em>wickyups</em>
(huts), that the enemy had a great drove of
horses and cattle, and that the presence of
Americans or Apache scouts in the country
was yet undreamed of.</p>

<p>Additional rations were pushed ahead to
Crawford and his command, the pack-trains
in rear taking their own time to march.
There was an abundance of wood in the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
grass grew in sufficiency, and the Bávispe
yielded water enough for a great army. The
stream was so clear that it was a pleasure to
count the pebbles at the bottom and to watch
the graceful fishes swimming within the
shadow of moss-grown rocks. The current
was so deep that, sinking slowly, with uplifted
arms, one was not always able to touch
bottom with the toes, and so wide that twenty
good, nervous strokes barely sufficed to propel
the swimmer from shore to shore. The water
was soft, cool, and refreshing, and a plunge
beneath its ripples smoothed away the wrinkles
of care.</p>

<p>On May 15, 1883, we climbed and marched
ten or twelve miles to the south-east, crossing
a piece of country recently burned over, the
air, filled with soot and hot dust, blackening
and blistering our faces. Many more old ruins
were passed and scores of walls of masonry.
The trail was slightly improved, but still bad
enough; the soil, a half-disintegrated, reddish
feldspar, with thin seams of quartz crystals.
There were also granite, sandstone, shale, quartzite,
and round masses of basalt. In the bottoms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of the cañons were all kinds of “float”&mdash;granite,
basalt, sandstone, porphyry, schist,
limestone, etc.; but no matter what the kind
of rock was, when struck upon the hill-sides it
was almost invariably split and broken, and
grievously retarded the advance.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="III">III.</h2>
</div>


<p>About noon of the 15th we had descended
into a small box cañon, where we were met by
two white men (packers) and nine Apache
scouts.</p>

<p>They had come back from Crawford with
news for which all were prepared. The enemy
was close in our front, and fighting might begin
at any moment. The scouts in advance
had picked up numbers of ponies, mules, burros,
and cattle. This conversation was broken
by the sudden arrival of an Apache runner,
who had come six miles over the mountains in
less than an hour. He reached us at 1.05, and
handed General Crook a note, dated 12.15, stating
that the advance-guard had run across the
Chiricahuas this morning in a cañon, and had
become much excited. Two Chiricahuas were
fired at, two bucks and a squaw, by scouts,
which action had alarmed the hostiles, and
their camp was on the move. Crawford would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
pursue with all possible rapidity. At the same
moment reports of distant musketry-firing were
borne across the hills. Crawford was fighting
the Chiricahuas! There could be no doubt
about that; but exactly how many he had
found, and what luck he was having, no one
could tell. General Crook ordered Chaffee to
mount his men, and everybody to be in readiness
to move forward to Crawford’s support, if
necessary. The firing continued for a time, and
then grew feeble and died away.</p>

<p>All were anxious for a fight which should
bring this Chiricahua trouble to an end; we
had an abundance of ammunition and a sufficiency
of rations for a pursuit of several days
and nights, the moon being at its full.</p>

<p>Shortly after dark Crawford and his command
came into camp. They had “jumped”
“Bonito’s” and “Chato’s” <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancherías</i>, killing
nine and capturing five&mdash;two boys, two girls,
and one young woman, the daughter of
“Bonito,” without loss to our side. From the
<ins class="corr" id="tn-76" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'dead Chiracahuas'">
dead Chiricahuas</ins> had been taken four nickel-plated,
breech-loading Winchester repeating
rifles, and one Colt’s revolver, new model. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Chiricahuas had been pursued across a fearfully
broken country, gashed with countless
ravines, and shrouded with a heavy growth of
pine and scrub-oak. How many had been
killed and wounded could never be definitely
known, the meagre official report, submitted by
Captain Crawford, being of necessity confined
to figures known to be exact. Although the
impetuosity of the younger scouts had precipitated
the engagement and somewhat impaired
its effect, yet this little skirmish demonstrated
two things to the hostile Chiricahuas; their
old friends and relatives from the San Carlos
had invaded their strongholds as the allies of
the white men, and could be depended upon
to fight, whether backed up by white soldiers
or not. The scouts next destroyed the village,
consisting of thirty <em>wickyups</em>, disposed in
two clusters, and carried off all the animals,
loading down forty-seven of them with plunder.
This included the traditional riffraff of
an Indian village: saddles, bridles, meat, mescal,
blankets, and clothing, with occasional
prizes of much greater value, originally stolen
by the Chiricahuas in raids upon Mexicans or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Americans. There were several gold and silver
watches, a couple of albums, and a considerable
sum of money&mdash;Mexican and American
coin and paper. The captives behaved with
great coolness and self-possession, considering
their tender years. The eldest said that her
people had been astounded and dismayed when
they saw the long line of Apache scouts rushing
in upon them; they would be still more
disconcerted when they learned that our guide
was “Peaches,” as familiar as themselves with
every nook in strongholds so long regarded as
inaccessible. Nearly all the Chiricahua warriors
were absent raiding in Sonora and Chihuahua.
This young squaw was positive that
the Chiricahuas would give up without further
fighting, since the Americans had secured all
the advantages of position. “Loco” and “Chihuahua,”
she knew, would be glad to live
peaceably upon the reservation, if justly treated;
“Hieronymo” and “Chato” she wasn’t
sure about. “Ju” was defiant, but none of his
bands were left alive. Most important information
of all, she said that in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ranchería</i> just
destroyed was a little white boy about six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
years old, called “Charlie,” captured by
“Chato” in his recent raid in Arizona. This
boy had run away with the old squaws when
the advance of the Apache scouts had been first
detected. She said that if allowed to go out
she would in less than two days bring in the
whole band, and Charlie (McComas) with them.
All that night the lofty peak, the scene of the
action, blazed with fire from the burning <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ranchería</i>.
Rain-clouds gathered in the sky, and,
after hours of threatening, broke into a severe
but brief shower about sunrise next morning (May 15).</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i104" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i104.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE GIRL WITH TYPICAL DRESS.</div>
</div>

<p>The young woman was given a little hard
bread and meat, enough to last two days, and
allowed to go off, taking with her the elder of
the boy captives. The others stayed with us and
were kindly treated. They were given all the
baked mescal they could eat and a sufficiency
of bread and meat. The eldest busied herself
with basting a skirt, but, like another Penelope,
as fast as her work was done she ripped it up
and began anew&mdash;apparently afraid that idleness
would entail punishment. The younger
girl sobbed convulsively, but her little brother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
a handsome brat, gazed stolidly at the world
through eyes as big as oysters and as black as jet.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, after the fitful showers
had turned into a blinding, soaking rain, the
Apache scouts made for these young captives a
little shelter of branches and a bed of boughs
and dry grass. Pickets were thrown out to
watch the country on all sides and seize upon
any stray Chiricahua coming unsuspectingly
within their reach. The rain continued with
exasperating persistency all day. The night
cleared off bitter cold and water froze in pails
and kettles. The command moved out from
this place, going to another and better location
a few miles south-east. The first lofty ridge
had been scaled, when we descried on the summit
of a prominent knoll directly in our front a
thin curl of smoke wreathing upwards. This
was immediately answered by the scouts, who
heaped up pine-cones and cedar branches,
which, in a second after ignition, shot a bold,
black, resinous signal above the tops of the
loftiest pines.</p>

<p>Five miles up and down mountains of no
great height but of great asperity led to a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
camping-place, at the junction of two well-watered
cañons, near which grew pine, oak, and
cedar in plenty, and an abundance of rich,
juicy grasses. The Apache scouts sent up a
second smoke signal, promptly responded to
from a neighboring butte. A couple of minutes
after two squaws were seen threading their
way down through the timber and rocks and
yelling with full voice. They were the sisters
of Tô-klani (Plenty Water), one of the scouts.
They said that they had lost heavily in the
fight, and that while endeavoring to escape
over the rocks and ravines and through the
timber the fire of the scouts had played havoc
among them. They fully confirmed all that
the captives had said about Charlie McComas.
Two hours had scarcely passed when six other
women had come in, approaching the pickets
two and two, and waving white rags. One of
these, the sister of “Chihuahua”&mdash;a prominent
man among the Chiricahuas&mdash;said that her
brother wanted to come in, and was trying to
gather up his band, which had scattered like
sheep after the fight; he might be looked for
in our camp at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>On the 18th (May, 1883), before 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
six new arrivals were reported&mdash;four squaws,
one buck and a boy. Close upon their heels followed
sixteen others&mdash;men, women, and young
children. In this band was “Chihuahua”
himself, a fine-looking man, whose countenance
betokened great decision and courage.</p>

<p>This chief expressed to General Crook his
earnest desire for peace, and acknowledged that
all the Chiricahuas could hope to do in the
future would be to prolong the contest a few
weeks and defer their destruction. He was
tired of fighting. His village had been destroyed
and all his property was in our hands.
He wished to surrender his band just as soon
as he could gather it together. “Hieronymo,”
“Chato,” and nearly all the warriors were absent,
fighting the Mexicans, but he (“Chihuahua”)
had sent runners out to gather up his
band and tell his people they must surrender,
without reference to what the others
did.</p>

<p>Before night forty-five Chiricahuas had come
in&mdash;men, women, and children. “Chihuahua”
asked permission to go out with two young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
men and hurry his people in. This was
granted. He promised to return without any
delay. The women of the Chiricahuas showed
the wear and tear of a rugged mountain life,
and the anxieties and disquietudes of a rugged
Ishmaelitish war. The children were models
of grace and beauty, which revealed themselves
through dirt and rags.</p>

<p>On May 19, 1883, camp was moved five of
six miles to a position giving the usual abundance
of water and rather better grass. It was
a small park in the centre of a thick growth of
young pines. Upon unsaddling, the Chiricahuas
were counted, and found to number seventy,
which total before noon had swollen to
an even hundred, not including “Chihuahua”
and those gone back with him.</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas were reserved, but good-humored.
Several of them spoke Spanish
fluently. Rations were issued in small quantity,
ponies being killed for meat. Two or
three of the Indians bore fresh bullet-wounds
from the late fight. On the succeeding evening,
May 20, 1883, the Chiricahuas were again
numbered at breakfast. They had increased to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
121&mdash;sixty being women and girls, the remainder,
old men, young men, and boys.</p>

<p>All said that “Chihuahua” and his comrades
were hard at work gathering the tribe together
and sending them in.</p>

<p>Toward eight o’clock a fearful hubbub was
heard in the tall cliffs overlooking camp; Indians
fully armed could be descried running
about from crag to crag, evidently much perplexed
and uncertain what to do. They began
to interchange cries with those in our midst,
and, after a brief interval, a couple of old
squaws ventured down the face of the precipice,
followed at irregular distances by warriors,
who hid themselves in the rocks half-way
down.</p>

<p>They asked whether they were to be hurt if
they came in.</p>

<p>One of the scouts and one of the Chiricahuas
went out to them to say that it made no difference
whether they came in or not; that “Chihuahua”
and all his people had surrendered,
and that if these new arrivals came in during
the day they should not be harmed; that until
“Chihuahua” and the last of his band had had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
a chance to come in and bring Charlie McComas
hostilities should be suspended. The Chiricahuas
were still fearful of treachery and hung
like hawks or vultures to the protecting shadows
of inaccessible pinnacles one thousand feet
above our position. Gradually their fears wore
off, and in parties of two and three, by various
trails, they made their way to General Crook’s
fire. They were a band of thirty-six warriors,
led by “Hieronymo,” who had just returned
from a bloody foray in Chihuahua. “Hieronymo”
expressed a desire to have a talk; but
General Crook declined to have anything to do
with him or his party beyond saying that they
had now an opportunity to see for themselves
that their own people were against them; that
we had penetrated to places vaunted as impregnable;
that the Mexicans were coming in from
all sides; and that “Hieronymo” could make
up his mind for peace or war just as he chose.</p>

<p>This reply disconcerted “Hieronymo;” he
waited for an hour, to resume the conversation,
but received no encouragement. He and his
warriors were certainly as fine-looking a lot of
pirates as ever cut a throat or scuttled a ship;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
not one among them who was not able to travel
forty to fifty miles a day over these gloomy
precipices and along these gloomy cañons. In
muscular development, lung and heart power,
they were, without exception, the finest body
of human beings I had ever looked upon. Each
was armed with a breech-loading Winchester;
most had nickel-plated revolvers of the latest
pattern, and a few had also bows and lances.
They soon began to talk with the Apache
scouts, who improved the occasion to inform them
that not only had they come down with General
Crook, but that from both Sonora and
Chihuahua Mexican soldiers might be looked
for in swarms.</p>

<p>“Hieronymo” was much humbled by this,
and went a second time to General Crook to
have a talk. He assured him that he had always
wanted to be at peace, but that he had
been as much sinned against as sinning; that he
had been ill-treated at the San Carlos and driven
away; that the Mexicans had been most treacherous
in their dealings with his people, and that
he couldn’t believe a word they said. They had
made war upon his women and children, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
had run like coyotes from his soldiers. He had
been trying to open communications with the
Mexican generals in Chihuahua to arrange for
an exchange of prisoners. If General Crook
would let him go back to San Carlos, and guarantee
him just treatment, he would gladly work
for his own living, and follow the path of peace.
He simply asked for a trial; if he could not
make peace, he and his men would die in these
mountains, fighting to the last. He was not a
bit afraid of Mexicans alone; but he could not
hope to prolong a contest with Mexicans and
Americans united, in these ranges, and with so
many Apache allies assisting them. General
Crook said but little; it amounted to this: that
“Hieronymo” could make up his mind as to
what he wanted, peace or war.</p>

<p>May 21st was one of the busiest days of the
expedition. “Hieronymo,” at early dawn, came
to see General Crook, and told him he wished for
peace. He earnestly promised amendment, and
begged to be taken back to San Carlos. He
asked permission to get all his people together,
and said he had sent some of his young men off
to hurry them in from all points. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
get them to answer his signals, as they imagined
them to be made by Apache scouts trying to
ensnare them. Chiricahuas were coming in all
the morning,&mdash;all ages, and both sexes,&mdash;sent in
by “Chihuahua” and his party; most of these
were mounted on good ponies, and all drove
pack and loose animals before them. Early in
the day there was seen winding through the pine
timber a curious procession,&mdash;mostly young warriors,
of an aggregate of thirty-eight souls,&mdash;driving
steers and work cattle, and riding ponies
and burros. All these were armed with Winchester
and Springfield breech-loaders, with revolvers
and lances whose blades were old cavalry
sabres. The little boys carried revolvers, lances,
and bows and arrows. This was the band of
Kaw-tenné (Looking-Glass), a young chief, who
claimed to be a Mexican Apache and to belong
to the Sierra Madre, in whose recesses he had
been born and raised.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i115.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE WARFARE.</div>
</div>

<p>The question of feeding all these mouths was
getting to be a very serious one. We had started
out with sixty days’ supplies, one-third of which
had been consumed by our own command, and
a considerable percentage lost or damaged when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
mules rolled over the precipices. The great
heat of the sun had melted much bacon, and
there was the usual wastage incident to movements
in campaign. Stringent orders were given
to limit issues to the lowest possible amount;
while the Chiricahuas were told that they must
cut and roast all the mescal to be found, and
kill such cattle and ponies as could be spared.
The Chiricahua young men assumed the duty
of butchering the meat. Standing within five
or six feet of a steer, a young buck would prod
the doomed beast one lightning lance-thrust
immediately behind the left fore-shoulder, and,
with no noise other than a single bellow of fear
and agony, the beef would fall forward upon its
knees, dead.</p>

<p>Camp at this period presented a medley of
noises not often found united under a military
standard. Horses were neighing, mules braying,
and bells jingling, as the herds were brought
in to be groomed. The ring of axes against the
trunks of stout pines and oaks, the hum of voices,
the squalling of babies, the silvery laughter of
children at play, and the occasional music of an
Apache fiddle or flute, combined in a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
discord which left the listener uncertain whether
he was in the bivouac of grim-visaged war or
among a band of school-children. Our Apache
scouts&mdash;the Tontos especially&mdash;treated the Chiricahuas
with dignified reserve: the Sierra Blancas
(White Mountain) had intermarried with
them, and were naturally more familiar, but all
watched their rifles and cartridges very carefully
to guard against treachery. The squaws
kept at work, jerking and cooking meat and
mescal for consumption on the way back to San
Carlos. The entrails were the coveted portions,
for the possession of which the more greedy or
more muscular fought with frequency.</p>

<p>Two of these copper-skinned “ladies” engaged
in a pitched battle; they rushed for each other
like a couple of infuriated Texas steers; hair
flew, blood dripped from battered noses, and
two “human forms divine” were scratched and
torn by sharp nails accustomed to this mode of
warfare. The old squaws chattered and gabbled,
little children screamed and ran, warriors
stood in a ring, and from a respectful distance
gazed stolidly upon the affray. No one dared
to interfere. There is no tiger more dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
than an infuriated squaw; she’s a fiend incarnate.
The packers and soldiers looked on, discussing
the “points” of the belligerents. “The little
one’s built like a hired man,” remarks one critic.
“Ya-as; but the old un’s a <em>He</em>, and doan’ you
forgit it.” Two rounds settled the battle in
favor of the older contestant, although the
younger remained on the ground, her bleeding
nostrils snorting defiance, her eyes blazing fire,
and her tongue volleying forth Apache imprecations.</p>

<p>But all interest was withdrawn from this
spectacle and converged upon a file of five
wretched, broken-down Mexican women, one of
whom bore a nursing baby, who had come within
the boundaries of our camp and stood in
mute terror, wonder, joy, and hope, unable to
realize that they were free. They were a party
of captives seized by “Hieronymo” in his last
raid into Chihuahua. When washed, rested,
and fed a small amount of food, they told a long,
rambling story, which is here condensed: They
were the wives of Mexican soldiers captured
near one of the stations of the Mexican Central
Railway just two weeks previously. Originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
there had been six in the party, but “Hieronymo”
had sent back the oldest and feeblest with
a letter to the Mexican general, saying that he
wanted to make peace with the whites, and
would do so, provided the Mexicans returned
the Apache women and children held prisoners
by them; if they refused, he would steal all the
Mexican women and children he could lay hands
on, and keep them as hostages, and would continue
the war until he had made Sonora and
Chihuahua a desert. The women went on to
say that the greatest terror prevailed in Chihuahua
at the mere mention of the name of
“Hieronymo,” whom the peasantry believed to
be the devil, sent to punish them for their sins.</p>

<p>“Hieronymo” had killed the Mexican soldiers
with rocks, telling his warriors he had no
ammunition to waste upon Mexicans. The
women had suffered incredible torture climbing
the rough skirts of lofty ranges, fording deep
streams of icy-cold water, and breaking through
morasses, jungles and forests. Their garments
had been rent into rags by briars and brambles,
feet and ankles scratched, torn, and swollen by
contusions from sharp rocks. They said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
when “Hieronymo” had returned to the heart
of the mountains, and had come upon one of
our lately abandoned camps, his dismay was
curious to witness. The Chiricahuas with him
made a hurried but searching examination of
the neighborhood, satisfied themselves that their
enemies&mdash;the Americans&mdash;had gained access to
their strongholds, and that they had with them
a multitude of Apache scouts, and then started
away in the direction of our present bivouac,
paying no further heed to the captured women
or to the hundreds of stolen stock they were
driving away from Chihuahua. It may be well
to anticipate a little, and say that the cattle in
question drifted out on the back trail, getting
into the foot-hills and falling into the hands of
the Mexicans in pursuit, who claimed their
usual wonderful “victory.” The women did
not dare to turn back, and, uncertain what
course to pursue, stayed quietly by the half-dead
embers of our old camp-fires, gathering up a
few odds and ends of rags with which to cover
their nakedness; and of castaway food, which
they devoured with the voracity of famished
wolves. When morning dawned they arose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
half frozen, from the couches they had made,
and staggered along in the direction taken by
the fleeing Chiricahuas, whom, as already narrated,
they followed to where they now were.</p>

<p>And now they were free! Great God!
Could it be possible?</p>

<p>The gratitude of these poor, ignorant, broken-down
creatures welled forth in praise and glorification
to God. “Praise be to the All-Powerful
God!” ejaculated one. “And to the most
Holy Sacrament!” echoed her companions.
“Thanks to our Blessed Lady of Guadalupe!”
“And to the most Holy Mary, Virgin of Soledad,
who has taken pity upon us!” It brought
tears to the eyes of the stoutest veterans to
witness this line of unfortunates, reminding us
of our mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters.
All possible kindness and attention were shown
them.</p>

<p>The reaction came very near upsetting two,
who became hysterical from over-excitement,
and could not be assured that the Chiricahuas
were not going to take them away. They did
not recover their natural composure until the
expedition had crossed the boundary line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Hieronymo” had another interview with
General Crook, whom he assured he wanted to
make a peace to last forever. General Crook
replied that “Hieronymo” had waged such
bloody war upon our people and the Mexicans
that he did not care to let him go back to San
Carlos; a howl would be raised against any
man who dared to grant terms to an outlaw for
whose head two nations clamored. If “Hieronymo”
were willing to lay down his arms and
go to work at farming, General Crook would
allow him to go back; otherwise the best thing
he could do would be to remain just where he
was and fight it out.</p>

<p>“I am not taking your arms from you,” said
the General, “because I am not afraid of you
with them. You have been allowed to go
about camp freely, merely to let you see that
we have strength enough to exterminate you if
we want to; and you have seen with your own
eyes how many Apaches are fighting on our
side and against you. In making peace with
the Americans, you must also be understood as
making peace with the Mexicans, and also that
you are not to be fed in idleness, but set to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
work at farming or herding, and make your
own living.”</p>

<p>“Hieronymo,” in his reply, made known his
contempt for the Mexicans, asserted that he
had whipped them every time, and in the last
fight with them hadn’t lost a man. He would
go to the San Carlos with General Crook and
work at farming or anything else. All he asked
for was fair play. He contended that it was
unfair to start back to the San Carlos at that
time, when his people were scattered like quail,
and when the women and children now in our
hands were without food or means of transportation.
The old and the little ones could
not walk. The Chiricahuas had many ponies
and donkeys grazing in the different cañons.
Why not remain one week longer? “Loco”
and all the other Chiricahuas would then have
arrived; all the ponies would be gathered up;
a plenty of mescal and pony-meat on hand, and
the march could be made securely and safely.
But if General Crook left the Sierra Madre, the
Mexicans would come in to catch and kill the
remnant of the band, with whom “Hieronymo,”
would cast his fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>General Crook acknowledged the justice of
much which “Hieronymo” had said, but declined
to take any action not in strict accord
with the terms of the convention. He would
now move back slowly, so as not to crowd the
young and feeble too much; they should have
time to finish roasting mescal, and most of those
now out could catch up with the column; but
those who did not would have to take the
chances of reaching San Carlos in safety.</p>

<p>“Hieronymo” reiterated his desire for peace;
said that he himself would start out to gather
and bring in the remnants of his people, and
he would cause the most diligent search to be
made for Charlie McComas. If possible, he
would join the Americans before they got out
of the Sierra Madre. If not, he would make
his way to the San Carlos as soon as this could
be done without danger; “but,” concluded he,
“I will remain here until I have gathered up
the last man, woman, and child of the Chiricahuas.”</p>

<p>All night long the Chiricahuas and the
Apache scouts danced together in sign of peace
and good-will. The drums were camp-kettles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
partly filled with water and covered tightly
with a well-soaked piece of calico. The drumsticks
were willow saplings curved into a hoop
at one extremity. The beats recorded one hundred
to the minute, and were the same dull,
solemn thump which scared Cortés <ins class="corr" id="tn-98" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'and his beleagured'">
and his beleaguered</ins> followers during <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">la Noche triste</i>.
No Caucasian would refer to it as music;
nevertheless, it had a fascination all its own
comparable to the whirr-r-r of a rattlesnake.
And so the song, chanted to the measure of the
drumming, had about it a weird harmony which
held listeners spell-bound. When the dance
began, two old hags, white-haired and stiff with
age, pranced in the centre of the ring, warming
up under the stimulus of the chorus until they
became lively as crickets. With them were
two or three naked boys of very tender years.
The ring itself included as many as two hundred
Indians of both sexes, whose varied costumes
of glittering hues made a strange setting
to the scene as the dancers shuffled and sang
in the silvery rays of the moon and the flickering
light of the camp-fires.</p>

<p>On May 23, 1883, rations were issued to 220<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Chiricahuas, and, soon after, Nané, one of the
most noted and influential of the Chiricahua
chiefs, rode into camp with seventeen of his
people. He has a strong face, marked with intelligence,
courage, and good nature, but with
an under stratum of cruelty and vindictiveness.
He has received many wounds in his countless
fights with the whites, and limps very perceptibly
in one leg. He reported that Chiricahuas
were coming in by every trail, and that all
would go to the San Carlos as soon as they
collected their families.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May the march back to the
San Carlos began. All the old Chiricahuas
were piled on mules, donkeys, and ponies; so
were the weak little children and feeble women.
The great majority streamed along on foot,
nearly all wearing garlands of cotton-wood
foliage to screen them from the sun. The distance
travelled was not great, and camp was
made by noon.</p>

<p>The scene at the Bávispe River was wonderfully
picturesque. Sit down on this flat rock
and feast your eyes upon the silver waves flashing
in the sun. Don’t scare that little girl who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
is about to give her baby brother a much-needed
bath. The little dusky brat&mdash;all eyes&mdash;is
looking furtively at you and ready to
bawl if you draw nearer. Opposite are two
old crones filling <em>ollas</em> (jugs or jars) of basket-work,
rendered fully water-proof by a coating
of either mesquite or piñon pitch. Alongside
of them are two others, who are utilizing the
entrails of a cow for the same purpose. The
splash and yell on your right, as you correctly
divine, come from an Apache “Tom Sawyer,”
who will one day mount the gallows. The
friendly greeting and request for “tobacco
shmoke” are proffered by one of the boys, who
has kindly been eating a big portion of your
meals for several days past, and feels so friendly
toward you that he announces himself in a
pleasant, off-hand sort of way as your “<em>Sikisn</em>”
(brother). Behind you are grouped Apache
scouts, whose heads are encircled with red flannel
bandages, and whose rifles and cartridges
are never laid aside. Horses and mules plunge
belly-deep into the sparkling current; soldiers
come and go, some to drink, some to get buckets
filled with water, and some to soak neck,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
face, and hands, before going back to dinner.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i129" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i129.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APACHE BASKET-WORK.</div>
</div>

<p>In this camp we remained several days. The
old and young squaws had cut and dried large
packages of “jerked” beef, and had brought
down from the hill-sides donkey-loads of mescal
heads, which were piled in ovens of hot stones
covered with wet grass and clay. The process
of roasting, or rather steaming, mescal takes
from three to four days, and resembles somewhat
the mode of baking clams in New England.
The Apache scouts passed the time
agreeably enough in gambling with the Chiricahuas,
whom they fleeced unmercifully, winning
hundreds of dollars in gold, silver, and
paper at the games of <em>monte</em>, <em>conquien</em>, <em>tzi-chis</em>,
and <em>mushka</em>.</p>

<p>The attractive pools of the Bávispe wooed
groups of white soldiers and packers, and
nearly the whole strength of the Chiricahua
women and children, who disported in the refreshing
waters with the agility and grace of
nereids and tritons. The modesty of the
Apaches of both sexes, under all circumstances,
is praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Chato” and “Loco” told General Crook
this morning that “Hieronymo” had sent them
back to say that the Chiricahuas were very
much scattered since the fight, and that he had
not been as successful as he anticipated in getting
them united and in corraling their herds of
ponies. They did not want to leave a single
one of their people behind, and urged General
Crook to stay in his present camp for a week
longer, if possible. “Loco,” for his part, expressed
himself as anxious for peace. He had
never wished to leave San Carlos. He wanted
to go back there and obtain a little farm, and
own cattle and horses, as he once did. Here it
may be proper to say that all the chiefs of the
Chiricahuas&mdash;“Hieronymo,” “Loco,” “Chato,”
“Nané,” “Bonito,” “Chihuahua,” “Maugas,”
“Zelé,” and “Kan-tenné”&mdash;are men of noticeable
brain power, physically perfect and mentally
acute&mdash;just the individuals to lead a forlorn
hope in the face of every obstacle.</p>

<p>The Chiricahua children, who had become
tired of swimming, played at a new sport to-day,
a mimic game of war, a school of practice
analogous to that established by old Fagan for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the instruction of young London pickpockets.
Three boys took the lead, and represented Mexicans,
who endeavored to outrun, hide from, or
elude their pursuers, who trailed them to their
covert, surrounded it, and poured in a flight of
arrows. One was left for dead, stretched upon
the ground, and the other two were seized and
carried into captivity. The fun became very
exciting, so much so that the corpse, ignoring
the proprieties, raised itself up to see how the
battle sped.</p>

<p>In such sports, in such constant exercise,
swimming, riding, running up and down the
steepest and most slippery mountains, the
Apache passes his boyish years. No wonder
his bones are of iron, his sinews of wire, his
muscles of India-rubber.</p>

<p>On May 27, 1883, the Chiricahuas had finished
roasting enough mescal to last them to
the San Carlos. One of the Apache scouts
came running in very much excited. He told
his story to the effect that, while hunting some
distance to the north, he had discovered a large
body of Mexican soldiers; they were driving
back the band of cattle run off by “Hieronymo,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and previously referred to. The scout
tried to communicate with the Mexicans, who
imagined him to be a hostile Indian, and fired
three shots at him. Lieutenant Forsyth, Al.
Zeiber, and a small detachment of white and
Indian soldiers started out to overtake the
Mexicans. This they were unable to do, although
they went some fifteen miles.</p>

<p>On the 28th, 29th, and 30th of May the
march was continued back toward the San
Carlos. The rate of progress was very slow,
the Mexican captives not being able to ride
any great distance along the rough trails, and
several of our men being sick. Two of the
scouts were so far gone with pneumonia that
their death was predicted every hour, in spite
of the assurances of the “medicine-men” that
their incantations would bring them through all
right. “Hieronymo,” “Chato,” “Kan-tenné,”
and “Chihuahua” came back late on the night
of the 28th, leading a large body of 116 of
their people, making an aggregate of 384 in
camp on the 29th.</p>

<p>On the 30th, after a march, quite long under
the circumstances,&mdash;fifteen to eighteen miles,&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
crossed the main “divide” of the Sierra
Madre at an altitude of something over 8,000
feet. The pine timber was large and dense,
and much of it on fire, the smoke and heat
parching our throats, and blackening our faces.</p>

<p>With this pine grew a little mescal and a
respectable amount of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">madroña</i>, or mountain
mahogany. Two or three deer were killed
by the Apache scouts, and as many turkeys;
trout were visible in all the streams. The line
of march was prolific in mineral formations,&mdash;basalt,
lava, sandstone, granite, and limestone.
The day the command descended the Chihuahua
side of the range it struck the trail of a
large body of Mexican troops, and saw an inscription
cut into the bark of a mahogany stating
that the Eleventh Battalion had been here
on the 21st of May.</p>

<p>The itinerary of the remainder of the homeward
march may be greatly condensed. The
line of travel lay on the Chihuahua side and
close to the summit of the range. The country
was extremely rough, cut up with rocky
cañons beyond number and ravines of great
depth, all flowing with water. Pine forests covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
all the elevated ridges, but the cañons and
lower foot-hills had vegetation of a different
character: oak, juniper, maple, willow, rose, and
blackberry bushes, and strawberry vines. The
weather continued almost as previously described,&mdash;the
days clear and serene, the nights
bitter cold, with ice forming in pails and kettles
on the 2d and 3d of June. No storms
worthy of mention assailed the command, the
sharp showers that fell two or three times being
welcomed as laying the soot and dust.</p>

<p>Game was found in abundance,&mdash;deer and
turkey. This the Apache scouts were permitted
to shoot and catch, to eke out the
rations which had completely failed, the last
issue being made June 4th. From that date
till June 11th, inclusive, all hands lived upon
the country. The Apaches improved the excellent
opportunity to show their skill as
hunters and their accuracy with fire-arms.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i138" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i138.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIGHTING THE PRAIRIE FIRE.</div>
</div>

<p>The command was threatened by a great
prairie fire on coming down into the broad
grassy valley of the Janos. Under the impetus
of a fierce wind the flames were rushing
upon camp. There was not a moment to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
lost. All hands turned out,&mdash;soldiers, scouts,
squaws, Chiricahua warriors, and even children.
Each bore a branch of willow or cotton-wood,
a blanket, or scrap of canvas. The conflagration
had already seized the hill-crest nearest
our position; brownish and gray clouds poured
skyward in compact masses; at their feet a
long line of scarlet flame flashed and leaped
high in air. It was a grand, a terrible sight:
in front was smiling nature, behind, ruin and
desolation. The heat created a vacuum, and
the air, pouring in, made whirlwinds, which
sent the black funnels of soot winding and
twisting with the symmetry of hour-glasses
almost to the zenith. For one moment the
line of fire paused, as if to rest after gaining
the hill-top; it was only a moment. “Here she
comes!” yelled the men on the left; and like
a wild beast flinging high its tawny mane of
cloud and flashing its fangs of flame, the fire
was upon, around, and about us.</p>

<p>Our people stood bravely up to their work,
and the swish! swish! swish! of willow brooms
proved that camp was not to be surrendered
without a struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>We won the day; that is, we saved camp,
herds, and a small area of pasturage; but over
a vast surface of territory the ruthless flames
swept, mantling the land with soot and an
opaque pall of mist and smoke through which
the sun’s rays could not penetrate. Several
horses and mules were badly burned, but none
to death.</p>

<p>For two or three nights afterwards the horizon
was gloriously lighted with lines of fire
creeping over the higher ridges. As we debouched
into the broad plain, through which
trickled the shriveled current of the Janos, no
one would have suspected that we were not a
column of Bedouins. A long caravan, stretched
out for a mile upon the trail, resolved itself
upon closer approach into a confused assemblage
of ponies, horses, and mules, with bundles
or without, but in every case freighted with
humanity. Children were packed by twos and
threes, while old women and feeble men got
along as best they could, now riding, now walking.
The scouts had decked themselves with
paint and the Chiricahua women had donned
all their finery of rough silver bracelets, wooden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
crosses, and saints’ pictures captured from Mexicans.
This undulating plain, in which we now
found ourselves, spread far to the north and
east, and was covered with bunch and grama
grasses, and dotted with cedar.&mdash;The march
brought us to Alisos Creek (an affluent of the
Janos), a thousand yards or more above the
spot where the Mexican commander García,
had slaughtered so many Chiricahua women
and children. Human bones, picked white and
clean by coyotes, glistened in the sandy bed of
the stream. Apache baskets and other furniture
were strewn about. A clump of graves
headed by rude crosses betrayed the severity of
the loss inflicted upon the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Between the 5th and 8th of June we crossed
back (west) into Sonora, going over the asperous
peak known as the Cocospera.</p>

<p>In this vicinity were many varieties of mineral&mdash;granite
gneiss, porphyry, conglomerate,
shale, sandstone, and quartz,&mdash;and travel was
as difficult almost as it had been in the earlier
days of the march. We struck the head waters
of Pitisco Creek, in a very rugged cañon, then
Elias Creek, going through another fine game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
region, and lastly, after crossing a broad tableland
mantled with grama grass, mesquite, Spanish
bayonet, and Palo Verde, mescal, and palmilla,
bivouacked on the San Bernardino river,
close to a tule swamp of blue, slimy mud.</p>

<p>The scouts plastered their heads with this
mud, and dug up the bulbs of the tule, which,
when roasted, are quite palatable.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June the command recrossed
the national boundary, and reached Silver
Springs, Arizona, the camp of the reserve under
Colonel Biddle, from whom and from all of
whose officers and men we received the warmest
conceivable welcome. Every disaster had been
predicted and asserted regarding the column,
from which no word had come, directly or indirectly
since May 5th. The Mexican captives
were returned to their own country and the
Chiricahuas marched, under Crawford, to the
San Carlos Agency.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the papers received at Silver
Springs were full of inflammatory telegrams,
stating that the intention of the government
was to hang all the Chiricahua men, without
distinction, and to parcel out the women and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
children among tribes in the Indian Territory.
This news, getting among the Chiricahuas, produced
its legitimate result. Several of the
chiefs and many of the head men hid back in
the mountains until they could learn exactly
what was to be their fate. The Mexican troops
went in after them, and had two or three severe
engagements, and were, of course, whipped each
time. When the road was clear the Chiricahuas
kept their promises to the letter, and brought
to the San Carlos the last man, woman, and
child of their people.</p>

<p>They have been quietly scattered in small
groups around the reservation, the object being
to effect tribal disintegration, to bring individuals
and families face to face with the progress
made by more peaceable Apaches, and at same
time to enable trusted members of the latter
bands to maintain a more perfect surveillance
over every action of the Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>Charlie McComas was never found; the Chiricahuas
insist, and I think truthfully, that he
was in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ranchería</i> destroyed by Crawford;
that he escaped, terror-stricken, to the depths
of the mountains; that the country was so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
rough, the timber and brush-wood so thick that
his tracks could not be followed, even had there
not been such a violent fall of rain during the
succeeding nights. All accounts agree in this.</p>

<p>Altogether the Chiricahuas delivered up
thirteen captives,&mdash;women and children,&mdash;held
by them as hostages.</p>

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
